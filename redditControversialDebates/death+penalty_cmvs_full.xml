There have been some good points made, particularly the one about Bethlehem and how it appears a nativity story needed to be "invented" to fit Jesus being from Nazareth, but I'm still not really convinced that the Gospels are fact and not fiction - mostly due to the fact that the knowledge we have about the use of the death penalty and the Jewish people's hate of the Romans make the idea they would have Jesus turned over to be killed and tortured highly implausible. 

Specifically, the Jewish people of the 1st century pretty much abolished the death penalty either around the time Jesus was supposedly killed, or in 70 AD when the Temple was destroyed, and were generally turning against it by the 1st century. If there was no crucifixion, there is no historical Jesus. 

Can anyone bring up points that might suggest that the Pharisees, Sadducees and Romans would all conspire to kill Jesus even though they were all at odds with each other and Jesus was supposedly a nobody during his lifetime? I just find it really hard to believe and I'm surprised historians don't factor this in more.

I should note I'm not writing this to bash religion. I'm an agnostic atheist, but I'm not an anti-theist. I think religion has personal value to many people, as well as evolutionary value, and I can't say for sure that religious people are wrong because that would be arrogant and I just don't know. 

I just find the idea that Jesus may have not existed incredibly interesting, partly because it makes me wonder how much of our "factual" knowledge about history is not really true. Secondly, I am disturbed by the bullying of knowledgeable people like Carrier by historical academia for not sticking to the consensus and it makes me wonder if there is some kind of payola going on in the field of Biblical studies, perhaps even from religious organizations.

OP:

As an ex-Catholic, I'm very interested in the idea that Jesus didn't exist at all. I'm pretty agnostic on the concept of Jesus historicity, I think it's possible he did live and also possible he didn't. 

However, from everything I've read there seems to be little evidence that Jesus was a real person. Sure, Josephus briefly mentions him, but this doesn't mean he had proof that Jesus existed. All it means is that Christians told him Jesus existed. It's also widely acknowledged even by faithful scholars that part of the Josephus quote is faked, which makes the whole thing seem fishy. The Tacitus quote is even worse and shows visible signs of being tampered with.

Considering the Gospels present an image of a person who was able to attract massive crowds and had a very dramatic execution you would think that there would be some conclusive evidence of his works and his apostles in Judea from that time period, but we've found nothing that is provably contemporary.

Unless you are a Christian and believe the miracles in the Gospels actually took place, there's no reason to accept *any* of it as historical. The nativity narrative is implausible, the magical parts obviously didn't happen, and there's no way any of the quotes would have been remembered accurately, even if there was a real Jesus. 

The only part that has any possible historical value is the crucifixion under Pilate, since we know he existed, but even that reads as drama rather than a telling of a historical event. I don't count the baptism because we have no historical references to John the Baptist that are from sources other than those that reference Jesus.

It seems like the arguments that Bart Ehrman and other ardent defenders of Jesus's historicity put out mostly rely on arguments from authority and appeals to Occam's Razor. The Principle of Embarassment in my opinion is not proof because we really don't know exactly how people during that time and place thought, and the idea that the fact Christianity spread so fast and people died for it means nothing, because people also died for Heaven's Gate and John Frum never existed yet people believe in him.

Scholars will dismiss Christ myth theorists by pointing out they don't have the same credentials they do, but unless they have access to some hidden knowledge about Christ, all of the few pieces of evidence for Jesus are easily discoverable on the Internet if you are curious, and none of them seem very convincing. Not only that, but Richard Carrier does have a PhD in ancient history, so he is not just some quack who wrote a few books for lulz. This is somebody who is admittedly biased being a militant atheist, but also very much a person who knows his shit saying that Jesus probably didn't exist.

I especially laugh at claims that we know more about Jesus than about George Washington or Julius Caesar. We don't have Jesus's teeth, we don't even know where he was buried. There aren't coins minted with Jesus's face on them, nor are there records of him taking over large chunks of Europe and still-existing structures built by his dynasty.

*All we have* are Christian sources and a couple probably fake quotes, none of which were produced in his lifetime. I think Jesus was either totally different from how the Gospels describe him and people essentially made up the stories in them, or he didn't exist at all and was merely the result of rumors that trickled from Israel into Turkey where Paul lived about a miracle worker (ie the "brother of Jesus" Paul claimed to have met), and they more or less made up the Jesus character as they saw fit.

What is the best evidence that Jesus did in fact exist and the Gospels are at least somewhat historically accurate? Is there any crucial detail I'm missing? I'm not necessarily saying I buy the Christ Myth theory, but I don't entirely buy the idea that we are 100 percent sure he existed either.

<submission><id>1</id><identifier>2xvx52</identifier><title>CMV: Abortion Is Far More Than Just Religion VS Science</title><commentCount>377</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2xvx52/cmv_abortion_is_far_more_than_just_religion_vs/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>People act like Abortion is some sort of a war between religion and science, but honestly, there's so much more to it.

The bible never mentions abortion, as it was not possible at the time. Any church claiming abortion is sin is merely a matter of interpretation. A fetus is interpreted as life, therefore intentionally killing it is interpreted as killing, thus a sin. 

As a result of Christianity determining it to be a sin, it does in fact cause people to be pro-life, simply because they fear what religious consequence may occur(heaven/hell). Thus, religions have taken an interpretive stance on a moral issue, and preached it as religious issue.

The end result is that interpretation by religious leaders resulted in religions acclimating to this belief as a whole, thus developing the association between religion and the concept of abortion.

At the same time, people treat abortion like a scientific feat. We discovered how to 'safely' terminate an unintended pregnancy. There is so much more reason to oppose it than religious purposes, however. Simply because a seemingly useful technology becomes available does not immediately confirm that it is morally acceptable, unless that's what your relative view of morality leads you to believe. Weaponry such as guns and explosives are products of science and research, but violence isn't seen as moral. Violence is only determined as moral when it is interpreted as a "necessary evil", such as putting an end to a greater evil.

When people argue about abortion, it comes down to one thing; do we interpret a fetus as life? Scientists will say no, because it doesn't fit an arbitrary definition. A fetus is dependent on the Woman's body, thus it isn't "life". But should we really base our decision off of an arbitrary definition established for the sake of classification?

A 1 day old child cannot survive on its own. If a women abandoned a baby to die by not feeding it, she would be seen as a murderer, a terrible person, deserving life in prison or even the death penalty. Yet a woman receiving an abortion is praised by many for utilizing her rights to her body.

This is a clear result of human empathy and emotion. Morality is defined by the emotional and empathetic response we develop to particular actions.

When we see faces, we develop a sense of connection or value in human life. Empathy is likely an evolutionary trait. If people feel connected and value each other, they're more likely to help each other, thus stay alive and grow as a population. 

When a woman gets an abortion, there isn't as much to trigger an empathetic response. When we see a clump of cells, or an underdeveloped fetus, our minds do not think much of it. We do not develop the emotional connection that leads us to value this form of life.

It is not the same life as a woman, however. It is an entirely different product of combined DNA/chromosomes of the male and female, supported by a Woman's body. Thus, saying it is the "woman's body" isn't necessarily true, if you're also referring to the fetus itself.

We see a fetus as incomplete. Some forms of abortion can be extremely painful for the fetus. Do we define it as immoral once either emotion or physical senses are developed? Or is intentionally sabotaging an established product of DNA and chromosomes immoral?

**I believe abortion is an issue of morality, and this morality results entirely from empathetic and emotional stimulation.**

In the end, I think beliefs on abortion are relative. How evil is it, if at all? At what level of development is it immoral? In cases of rape, an abortion can help a victim not have to deal with raising a child alone.

In cases of severe birth defects(such as resulting from incest), it can prevent someone that would struggle to come to life. Is it worth it to let them live? You don't know if the person coming to life would want to live in that state, that cannot be answered until they're grown and developed.

**While an empathetic response, it can still be interpreted as a necessary evil in some cases**

I'm not taking a side for or against abortion, so don't try to sway me either way with common arguments-I've looked into both sides extensively. Try to discredit my argument with additional information such as elements of psycology I may be unaware of, or things about fetus development I may be unaware of. I'm not a biologist, so I'm sure there's much for me to learn.

While there are some well intentioned people who want to rehabilitate criminals, oftentimes people simply want revenge (e.g. the death penalty in general).  While it is necessary to protect society from those that would harm it, intentionally hurting criminals beyond what is needed to keep them separated from society and rehabilitated is morally repugnant cruelty.  

People in favor of a punitive justice system often believe that some people are impossible to rehabilitate and thus are worthless.  However, if they are impossible to rehabilitate, then what is being gained by punishing them at all?  Why make their lives miserable out of vengeance when we have already acknowledged that this punishment has no chance of actually changing their behavior leading to a release?  I believe this is wrong, CMV.

There are also many, many uses of taxes of which I disapprove (examples: war, electricity for accent lighting at government buildings (negligible, but wasteful in principle), and the death penalty). I’m forced to pay (at least partially) for all of these things and offered no way to choose where my money goes.

Apparently, I consented to these conditions by being born. If I refuse to pay taxes, I’m fined. If I refuse to pay the fine, I’m eventually sent to prison. If I refuse to go to prison, I’m physically transported there. If I attempt to leave, I will probably eventually end up being bodily harmed.

~~I’m not sure how so many people condone this.~~

My main complaint is that I will eventually end up in physical danger if I refuse to fund warfare while remaining in my home. This is fundamentally wrong.

edit: [definition of theft](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2kmgdw/cmv_taxation_is_basically_theft/clmon6u)

edit 2: I misphrased my title. I think that *involuntary* taxation is theft.

edit 3: I concede that there are some government services which can’t be rendered selectively (example: fire departments), so regardless of whether or not taxation is theft, the service can’t feasibly be provided to anyone without providing it to everyone else.

edit 4: This is eating my time, so I won’t be replying any more.

<submission><id>4</id><identifier>460mru</identifier><title>CMV: Supporters of Bernie Sanders have turned reddit into an echo chamber devoid of critical evaluations of his policies.</title><commentCount>286</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/460mru/cmv_supporters_of_bernie_sanders_have_turned/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I support Bernie and believe my life and the lives of my family members would be improved more by his policies than other candidates' policies. I believe he is telling it like it is, for the most part, but I worry reddit is becoming the new "Facebook for Ron Paul 2012."

Critical evaluations of his policies are few and far between. Reddit is a steady supply of articles which confirm our bias in favor of him, but maybe we are doing ourselves a disservice by completely shutting off any opposing ideas.

Redditors pride themselves with being atheistic logicians, detectives able to see through the lies, and deliverers of social justice. Where is the opportunity for the other points of view? A few days ago, someone on this sub said the southern states should be "kicked from the union" because their regressive policies are destroying America.

What happened to this country being a democracy? I do not agree with those wanting to ban abortion but continue the death penalty. I don't think people are idiots that have that view though, and think they should be heard and their opinions considered. Babies are innocent, criminals are not. I understand the sentiment, but our justice system is not good enough at determining guilt to execute someone. Too many innocent people die by the state, it is better for 100 guilty men to go free than one innocent to suffer, etc., etc.

I feel redditors should seek out the problems with policy Bernie wants to impose. It would allow our understanding to deepen, clarify our position and maybe even make some other redditors feel the Bern.

Delta awarded.

My perception has been altered by /u/helpful_hank because [he showed me](https://en.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/460mru/cmv_supporters_of_bernie_sanders_have_turned/d01nnfs) I must acknowledge the role reddit serves as a meeting place for his most active and passionate supporters.

Edit for clarity: I am aware of /r/neutralpolitics and /r/politicaldiscussion. However, I think their obscurity supports my original view. Also, I am not saying every person on reddit is a blind follower. I am saying those who are critical of Bernie are suppressed by his supporters to the point that few people have their views/understanding of policies critically challenged. I was religious, I avoided critiques of my religious beliefs for a long time. Once I challenged them I stopped being religious. I think it is beneficial to question what you believe.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>5</id><identifier>4nvf62</identifier><title>CMV:The Orlando shooter was propelled by BOTH his religious beliefs as well mental instability.</title><commentCount>267</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4nvf62/cmvthe_orlando_shooter_was_propelled_by_both_his/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>In the wake of this atrocity, a myriad of various opinions have been voiced, both here on Reddit as well as the rest of the Web and the world. Among the most prevalent viewpoints is that *Omar Mateen was motivated by his adherence to Islam*. As an ex-Muslim, I've devoted a lot of time and thought to pondering the values and tenets of my former religion, as well as scanning various online forums pertaining to Islam and atheism. The Orlando shooting has actuated the expression of different comments such as "Religion of peace? LOL" or "This is why Islam is evil to the core." I'm no expert, but I'd like to probe further into the claims of religion's role in this crime. More than anything, I want you to test my stance on Islam and its contribution to terrorism.

Undoubtedly, Mateen was a Muslim and placed faith in Islam. *Did he actually follow the genuine teachings of Islam, or did he "mutate" Islam and distort its teachings?* For now, I'd ignore the nuances of Islamic teachings and whether he actually followed them or not. This is simply because **the Qur'an and the hadith contain such a vast range of teachings (that often contradict one another) that it's hard to discern whether Islam condones or condemns homosexuality, misogyny, apostasy, and such**. Trying to figure out what "Islam really says" would take a whole new post. You are welcome to challenge this conclusion.

For now, though, I think it would be best to focus on one single statement: **Omar Mateen's hatred on homosexuals originates from his belief in Islam.** Whether Islam actually mandates hatred of homosexuals is another question entirely. 

This is why he "got angry after observing two men in Miami kiss." His own father attested to his homophobia, and Mateen's decision to shoot up a gay club pays testimony to his attitude towards gay people. The shooting has been rightly labeled a hate crime, and I believe that his hatred of gays comes purely from his adherence to Islam. The Qur'an labels homosexuality a "transgression", spurring Muslims to adopt grave antagonism towards homosexuals. This is common knowledge.

But I also believe that when people are blaming solely Islam for this crime, they're wrong. Yes, without doubt, Islam played a prominent role, but his mental instability is what actually propelled him to barge into a club and claim 50 lives. His ex-wife informed us that he was "not a stable person" and was abusive. His co-worker said he was "belligerent." **This points to mental instability and difficulty with managing his temper.**

Most Muslims are upset when seeing two men kiss. Most Muslims do not support gay rights. *But at the same time, most Muslims do not consider walking into a club and slaughtering gay people.* Even if a Muslim supports Shariah law and even the death penalty for homosexual activities, he or she would probably not feel compelled to *personally* kill a gay person. Mentally stable people just don't tend to adopt genuinely murderous attitudes.

This is where mental instability comes in. Mateen clearly demonstrates mental instability. This is why he entered a club and slaughtered 50 people. **His Muslim faith gave rise to his hatred of gays, but it was his mental problems that propelled him to commit mass murder.**

You are welcome to point out flaws in my reasoning. The primary reason I wrote this is because my older Muslim sister is attending university in the US this August (we live in Bangladesh) and I'm worried about the burgeoning anti-Muslim sentiment in America. She supports LGBT rights just as much as I do and, like most Muslims, condemns these killings. The bottom line here is that simply because *someone is a part of a culture that embraces a violent ideology does not mean that that someone agrees with that ideology's tenets.*

Thanks for reading!

<submission><id>6</id><identifier>3z79r4</identifier><title>CMV: Abortion is wrong, and one can justify this position from a secular perspective.</title><commentCount>273</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3z79r4/cmv_abortion_is_wrong_and_one_can_justify_this/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>So I'll break this case down into 3 main parts

1. Killing an innocent ~~person~~ human is wrong
2. A foetus is innocent
3. A foetus is a ~~person~~ human

If i prove these individually, it follows that abortion is wrong.

**Fringe case where some of the above premises may not apply**

* Killing an innocent person may not be considered wrong if inaction is likely to result in the death of both parties. I.e. If there is a threat to the life of the mother, abortion *may* not be wrong as inaction would result in the death of both the mother and the foetus.

* I use *may* because the above case is a grey area; obviously, the threat would need to be clear, present and direct. Coming up with a non-arbitrary quantum for this is a challenge

**1 - Killing an innocent person is wrong**

To determine whether something is wrong, we need to come to some basic understanding of what "right" and "wrong" means in the context of a western secular democracy.

Our legal system has a term for the pre-meditated killing of an innocent person - murder. Most moral frameworks hold the killing of an innocent person to be the height of immorality. 

One common argument for abortion is that it reduces crime and is "better off" for the child in the long run, particularly if they are born into poverty - this is a utilitarian moral perspective. I'll address this point now. Obviously, there *are* times where killing an innocent person may be considered acceptable. The most obvious example is a drone or missile strike, where there is a statistical likelihood that there will be civilian collateral damage - war is still pursued for "the greater good". These are rare, and avoided like a plague, but they do happen. 

This isn't a valid example of one of those cases, because, if my other two points are true, then one could just as easily apply this argument to children, or adolescents or even adults. If killing an innocent person is justified because it might prevent crime in a very indirect and abstract sense, then why not enforce the death penalty for all crimes? Moreover, this utilitarian calculus is very rare in western societies, where we tend to prioritize individual rights and dignity over net social outcomes.

**2 - A foetus is innocent**

Obviously, a foetus is innocent in the sense that they haven't committed any wrongs that society would consider worthy of death. I live in a country without the death penalty and without "stand your ground" or "castle" laws, there is absolutely no situation where the state can kill an innocent person. 

There is a pro abortion argument that centre's around this premise:

* A foetus is violating a woman's bodily autonomy 
 * Consensual sex - if a woman chose to have sex, with or without contraception, then she consented to the possibility that she could become pregnant. She is therefore responsible for giving birth to the child. In a similar vein, if you sign up for a mortgage, then you consent to giving up your autonomy to labour without compensation. 
* Rape - this is still wrong, because killing an innocent person is wrong. It is perhaps *legally* ambiguous because of the issue of consent and potential mental health problems

**3 -  A foetus is a ~~person~~ human**

This is a big part of the argument. Firstly, some context. People have been using the "oh; $x isn't *really* a person" and dehumanization more generally to justify atrocities for a long, long time. The US used it to justify slavery, the Nazi's used it to justify the holocaust. I'll break this down into 2 broad concepts, humanity and personhood.

1. Humanity - the accepted, scientific litmus test to determine whether something is a member of a particular species is to determine whether the thing in question is an independent organism (in the most basic sense, not independent as in "can survive outside the womb" sense) AND whether it is genetically a member of the species in question. This test eliminates the sperm cell and skin cell reductio ad absurdum arguments:

* A sperm cell only contains half of the genetic information required for it to be considered human
* A Skin cell isn't an independent organism, it is part of a larger organism

2. Personhood - the entire notion of personhood is completely arbitrary. People attribute significance to "consiousness", "viability", "intelligence" and "heartbeats". Obviously, there is no discrete point where a foetus transitions from a non-human to a human. None of you will argue this, you'll argue that it's some sort of spectrum. This begs the question; if there is a "spectrum" of personhood", baby who lacks the intelligence, independence and even consciousness (to some degree) of a child "less of a person"? Is a child "less of a person" than an adolescent? 

The only way you can argue that a foetus isn't a person is if you create some sort of "model" of what a person is, and a set of attributes that you can test for. Is it having a heartbeat? Well, lot's of animals have heartbeats, and they not only more valuable than a human foetus but also entitled to basic rights. What about consiousness, empathy, intelligence? Again, these are attributes that a baby lacks and that certain animals possess, yet we obviously value a human baby more than an intelligent pig.

The salient point is that personhood is arbitrary, and the only significant question is humanity.


Since a foetus is an innocent ~~person~~ human, and since killing an innocent person is wrong, abortion is wrong.
q.e.d.

I'd like to find out if i've made a mistake in framing this problem, or haven't properly proven one of the components - CMV

EDIT: Clarified personhood issue -

That said, you can still have rules without government, and you can still want to live in a morally righteous community, be it your own family or your entire 'state' or what have you.

Regardless, I think we can all agree that murder is wrong, that killing someone or something is wrong. 

So then it becomes a matter of, well, when does life begin. It seems pretty clear to me that life begins at conception, there's just no way around that. *Sentience*, something innately *human*, you could argue occurs later (3 days before birth? 3 months?), but regardless, a *life* is formed at conception.

And once life is bestowed, you must kill it, extinguish it, snuff out it's flame, in order to end it. 

I just don't see how abortion is... morally, okay. You have the ability to endow life, but you *should* not have the authority to end life. Life is precious (cough death penalty is absolutely barbaric cough).

Now, I am not saying abortion should be outlawed necessarily. I mean if a woman intends to kill their unborn, how do you stop them, how would you prosecute against that, if someone is so sick to think that their convenience is more important than a life, would you even want that person to raise a child at all,  banning abortion just leads to more risky back alleyway abortions, I mean there's all sorts of... practical grounds, that banning abortion does not work.

But morally speaking, I just don't understand how abortion is okay. It is not the woman's body anymore, there is someone else's body in there, regardless of the fact if it's parasitic or relies entirely on the host/mother/whatever to survive.

Even if there is ample evidence, with multiple convictions, including the killing of guards, other prison workers or other prisoners, can be dragged out for decades and cost society millions more than simply keeping that person incarcerated for the decades they’re likely to live. The social and rational costs are also high, with people being relatively mum on wanting to call ourselves civilized while still allowing the death penalty.

Why is this related to suicide exactly? Because I believe it should be within a prisoner’s right, as well as the medically ill or physically and mentally disabled, to choose to end their life with a modicum of dignity. 
No one should be forced to live in a prison for many decades, as the Boston Bomber will do even if he eventually gets the death penalty, with no real ability to escape their self-imposed imprisonment. We are already condemning them to die within the walls of a prison, why not just allow them to choose, as other humans should be able to, when their life inside ends? Note here, I’m more specifically talking about the more serious felonies and people who are stuck in prison for the rest of their life, as well as other serial rapists, murderers, child abusers and their ilk.
On a related point, as my grandfather was able to do with his terminal cancer that he fought through for a few years in his old age, people with terminal or severe physical or mental deficiency should be allowed to choose to end their own life. I’m not saying, as with the prisoners, that this should be imposed on them or that everyone should necessarily allowed to do it, as many people might choose this when there is much help that can be offered to change their views. But my grandfather was simply going to die with multi-system cancer that was not abated by the medical technology that was around at that time, and choosing to plan his own funeral and estate before he died, instead of staying in immense pain for another few weeks to maybe a year, is a right all people should have, not something that is shamed and made illegal for whatever reasons we still make it illegal.
Much of this stems from what I believe I would like to do, and if I were ever a prisoner, I’d like that dignity, as well as if and when I’m old enough and sick enough, even with the technology that will invariably allow us first world people to live well past 100, to end my life in the same dignity.

<submission><id>9</id><identifier>24vet7</identifier><title>CMV: I believe there is something inherently disturbing/wrong with Japanese culture.</title><commentCount>228</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/24vet7/cmv_i_believe_there_is_something_inherently/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>It's a longstanding joke throughout the internet that the Japanese come up with crazy TV shows or weird porn, but I can't help but feel as though there is something intrinsically wrong with Japanese culture. 

I know this is not a politically correct opinion at all (which is why I am asking someone to change my view) and by so many features, Japan seems like a fantastic place to be i.e. powerhouse economy in East Asia, high levels of public education, amazing life expectancy rates, a highly involved and civic-minded society, amazingly clean (ecologically/visually) cities, and the list goes on.

Unfortunately, the long list of pros is marred by certain glaring cons most notably sexual attitudes in Japan. 

1. Sexual harassment is an enormous problem in Japan and is simply not addressed adequately either by society or the government. Japanese trains have had so many problems with groping that they have had to implement female only train cars: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/International/story?id=803965
Furthermore, Japanese students are encouraged to ride bicycles on their own instead to prevent such cases and while this measure makes sense, it seems to ignore changing the cultural attitudes ingrained in society that prevent women from speaking out or men from refraining from such actions.

2. The degree to which pedophilia is accepted and even celebrated is especially disturbing. Although those who act on it and enough evidence is found will be prosecuted just like other countries, "To a degree, it has become socially accepted to lust over young girls in Japan." As the NYT article goes on to say, many steps have been taken by the government to crack down on these images, but the laws are still far more lax than in other countries which still allow photoshoots of extremely young girls e.g. 6 years old
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/global/10manga.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0

3. It seems as though a lot of younger Japanese people simply don't know how to date/interact with the opposite gender. Due to the bizarre sexual attitudes that a significant proportion of the Japanese male population holds, when it comes to actually interacting with women they simply can't do so. Obviously in such a heavily work-oriented culture, it is difficult to find the time and resources to develop a relationship but is it really this that explains why the Japanese birth rate is so low that their country is in danger of having to support the oldest population in the world? Can it really just be summed down to work culture and expenses?
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex

4. The cult worship/acceptance of certain high-profile murderers/rapists is another disconcerting point for me. One case that stood out in particular was Issei Sagawa who murdered and proceeded to eat a Dutch women. However, rather than people demanding the death penalty or life imprisonment for him and while I'm sure there were people who did, he became a celebrity in Japan and made a living off of his crimes. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issei_Sagawa
Additionally, I just came from a reddit thread in which redditors once again listed off disturbing things they had uncovered during their adventures throughout the Internet and I couldn't help but notice that cases of Japanese depravity cropped up once more which leads me to my final point and I guess the most controversial: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24u8c9/what_is_the_creepiest_or_most_disturbing_thing/

5. [This section on history will be in three parts.] History is a particularly vicious beast for any country that's been around long enough. Just in the past two centuries, the Germans have had their Holocaust, the Americans the practice of slavery and killing of native americans, etc... However, the Japanese seemed to have particularly brutal practices in the period leading up to and during WWII. In the reddit thread listed above, there were cases of cannibalism by the Japanese of American servicemen the likes of which never really happened for the Allied powers. In reading Fly Boys, it wasn't out of necessity either these pilots were eaten so that the Japanese officers could become stronger warriors and consume their power. It was also seen as a delicacy of sorts among Japanese officers.

6. (History continued) Secondly, the Rape of Nanking is possibly one of the most disturbing incidents in modern history. The absolute depravity of Japanese soldiers in cutting open pregnant women to make bets on the gender of babies, raping infants and old people, decapitation competitions, setting up comfort women stations and thus, establshing systematised sexual slavery all across the Pacific all have a certain psychosexual edge not present in other cultures as they fought their own wars. The Germans sought to create a perfect society and while there were definitely horrifying cases of depravity, it was conducted in a very scientific, cold, and calculating manner. The reason why the Nuremburg trials were so "easy" was because the germans kept meticulous records as to how many were killed, transported, imprisoned etc... The Japanese on the other hand operated with uncontrolled and even encouraged savagery that did not place individuals into a system that they committed crimes through but with their own bare hands. This wanton bloodlust was su unnerving that even the Nazis tried to protect some Chinese people from the Japanese onslaught. 
http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/12/world/at-the-rape-of-nanking-a-nazi-who-saved-lives.html?pagewanted=all

7. [History continued] Unit 731 is especially notorious and is so disturbing that I really think that just reading the article is self explanatory. Experiments involving biological and chemical warfare and vivisection were commonplace and standard operating procedure in a camp like this and it just seems so uniquely sadistic that it's difficult for me to find countries that have done similar practices with elements being seen even today in culture. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731

Note: Not to sound pretentious, but I've read a considerable amount on Japanese history and culture in an attempt to understand why it is so. With the historical examples, I have heard that the reason why Japanese soldiers were so brutal was because they came from largely impoverished backgrounds and were incredibly angry at what they saw to be an incapable and weak government that was only repressing them. Thus, they took their rage out on people who they had been indoctrinated to believe were less than human with the Japanese being of a superior race. 

I know this is a very sensitive and personal topic for some and it's difficult for me to even write this because I hold no ill will towards them. I hope that you guys can change my view without just ignoring my points or accusing me of being a racist. Not that this changes anything, but I myself am Asian-American which is a major factor as to how I have been educated about the Japanese and their historical actions.

CMV!



Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone who commented for giving me several things to think about. I found out while reading that my views were broadening and it is nigh impossible to say Japanese culture or any culture really is wrong. I have come to say that there are certain disturbing elements which I find unique to the culture that while present elsewhere are more emphasised in Japan. However, this may also be as some pointed out, confirmation bias. Although I can't say that my opinion has flipped, your input has given me much to think about and I really appreciate your not simply deriding and dismissing this controversial opinion.

We all get along just fine despite this. We talk politics all the time, but it never gets personal, and we simply discuss these issues and share our views with one another without getting angry. IMO, this situation seems perfectly normal to me. However, so many other people I know seem to think it's weird, and say things like "I could never be friends with people who hold X opinion." Why not? I just don't get why some people are like this. Why do you need someone to agree with your own views before you befriend them? Are you so insecure that you need everyone to agree with you at all times? That seems unbelievably childish to me.

<submission><id>11</id><identifier>1uuk4g</identifier><title>I think that the only rational and logical stance on the abortion issue is pro-life. CMV.</title><commentCount>200</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1uuk4g/i_think_that_the_only_rational_and_logical_stance/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I attempted to approach the abortion issue the most rational way that I possibly could, and the only outcome that made any sense at all was pro-life. I'll list my justification for this stance, and I task you fine people of r/changemyview to find any holes in my logic, or to propose at least an equally logical argument for the pro-choice position.

My View:
The reason why I hold the stance I hold comes in two components. The aspect of my argument is the idea that unborn children are really valuable. Now, you will never hear me say something like, "Fetuses are people" or otherwise equate an unborn child to a human life, but I will argue that fetuses /are/ really valuable. I approached this conclusion using basic logic.

Think, if I were to kill three pigs and eat them, I'll have a fine barbeque. If I were to kill three two-month-old babies and eat them, I'll be lucky if I didn't get the death penalty. Yet your average adult pig beats a two month old baby in every category that would make someone worthwhile. The pig is smarter than the baby and can solve more complex problems. The pig can live independently while the two-month-old is utterly dependent on others. The pig can reproduce and make its own babies. The pig is better than the baby in all aspects except for one, and because of this we are left to assume that it is because of this one aspect that a baby is considered more valuable than a pig in both the eyes of the law and in the eyes of most rational thinking people. This aspect, of course, is potential. The baby has the potential to become a being with hopes and dreams, able to think critically, able to love and be loved, and this potential is something that the pig lacks, and thus the baby's life and well being is immensely more valuable than the pig's life and well being.

However, it should be noted that this potential that makes a baby who is dumber than a pig more valuable than a pig is also present in an unborn child. An unborn child can become all of the things that a born child can, and if this potential gives immense value to two-month-old babies then this potential should surely give some value to an unborn child. Like, if 90% of the value present in a two-month-old baby lies in the potential of what that two-month-old baby can become, and an unborn child has like 80% of the potential that a two-month-old baby has because unborn children are significantly more likely to perish than born children, then an unborn child should be at least 70% as valuable as an two-month-old baby, and since killing a two-month-old will fetch you the same punishment as killing a twenty year old in the eyes of the law, we can take for granted the fact that a two-month-old is at least as valuable as any human being of another age, meaning that an unborn child would be 70% as valuable as a human being of any age.

Now, you could argue that an unborn child is so much more likely to perish than a born child that it impacts the potential of unborn children significantly more than I said, but I would argue that mortality rates don't really affect the value of the potential present in children all that much because even if infant mortality rates were ridiculously high, like 60%, it /still/ would not be okay to just go around murdering babies. 

You can argue that I'm overestimating the value of a human life, but I would argue that human beings are really valuable, and I'm not talking about the insurance company's type of value, I'm talking about intrinsic stuff here. Some would argue that a single human life is so valuable that ascribing a price to it is an insult, and I would argue that stance as well because the immensely great things that a single human can accomplish are not something that can be easily quantified.

In any event, I think that because of what I said before, it is only rational to presume that an unborn child is very valuable, or at least almost as valuable as a two-month-old baby which is just as valuable as any other human life. Which finally brings us to component number two of my reasoning as to why being pro-life is the most logical.

The primary argument from the pro-choice camp is that a woman has a right to her own body, and that to make her carry a baby to term is infringing upon that right. Now, I am a firm believer of the fact that a woman /does/ have the right to her own body, but I think that this should not be the only thing taken into consideration when considering the argument at hand. The thing that I think is not being taken into consideration from people who argue pro-choice is responsibility. Now, if a woman is raped, then it would be a crime to force her to carry that baby to term. No one is arguing against the fact that holding her responsible for a thing that she had no voluntary hand in creating is wrong.

But if a woman voluntarily takes on the risk of pregnancy and, because she voluntarily took on this risk, she gets pregnant, then you'd be hard pressed to convince me that she holds no responsibility for the unborn child that could only possibly exist because she knowingly made decisions that had a risk of causing the unborn child to exist. This is why men have to pay child support; because they are responsible for the child that they created with their own voluntarily actions, knowing the risks. If a man is responsible for what was created during the sexy times, then it's only logical to say that the woman is also responsible. 

We've already established that unborn children are immensely valuable, and I believe that a woman who is responsible for creating this immensely valuable thing should not have the right to shirk this responsibility. I've already stated that women have the right to control what goes on with their body, but I feel like the responsibility that they owe their unborn child usurps their right to do whatever the hell they want. And before you get your knickers in a twist about that, let's not forget that rights are given up all the time as a result of voluntary actions. I have the right to do what I want with my money as long as it's within the confines of the law, but if I play street baseball and break my neighbor's window, any judge will argue that my responsibility to pay for that window usurps that right. Any judge would argue that I knew the risks of playing street baseball, and since I knew those risks and took those risks, I am responsible for the results and have to pay for the broken window, even though this goes against my right to spend my money how I please. Of course this analogy isn't perfect by any means, but I think it accurately illustrates my belief that a woman's responsibility to her unborn child, which we've established is very valuable, can usurp her right to do what she wants with her body.

tl;dr: Unborn children are really valuable, women who have the sexy times take on the risk of creating this valuable thing and are responsible for this valuable thing if they do create it, therefore women should not be allowed to terminate this valuable thing.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>12</id><identifier>33fzqf</identifier><title>CMV: Saudi Arabia should be removed from the United Nations and stripped of all advantages that come with being part of the UN, due to their sexist governmental policies, harsh laws, and blatant human rights abuses</title><commentCount>188</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/33fzqf/cmv_saudi_arabia_should_be_removed_from_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Not only does Saudi Arabia violate the basic rights of every human being, several of the rights they infringe on are in direct and gross violation of the [United Nations Human Rights Declaration](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) set down by the United Nations after the atrocities of World War II. For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:

* Article 3

&gt; Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.

If one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as "dishonouring the family" or "acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:

&gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her "guardian", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.

Because of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant. The Mutawa of Saudi Arabia are very powerful as they serve as the religious police. They are so powerful that they have the power to prosecute a member of the Saudi Royal Family, which, to my knowledge, has never been done. The point is that they serve as a very powerful force in the oppression of  women in Saudi Arabia, and given the power of Sharia Law over the Saudis, they easily cast shadows on the liberty of all the women of Saudi Arabia.

* Article 5

&gt;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

This is probably the most infringed on right in the Kingdom. The punishments under the Law in Saudi Arabia include, but are not limited to, lashes, stoning, drowning, death by firing squad, death by crucifixion, death by beheading, with the option of public punishments, just as one would offer with a spectator sport. If Saudi Arabia allowed as much choice in the living of live as they did in the ending of life, they would be much better off.

Out of these items, three stand out. Cruxifiction, stoning, and beheading are all barbaric and extremely cruel ways of punishment. In the case of beheading, during the process, I can only imagine that the subject would experience immense pain as the executioner proceeded to cut through his throat, then the thick muscles of his neck, and then all the way through the spinal cord. There is no debate that this is a violation of Article 5. Cruxifiction , for those who don't know, means that you would be nailed to a plank of wood or some such surface to bleed out, or more likely, die of starvation or stoning while nailed to the wall like an animal skin. I'm not even going to bother explaining why that infringes son Article 5. Lastly, stoning. Since when has having stones hurled at you a normal punishment? Not only is it extremely degrading, it is also extremely cruel, and extremely stupid. I think I've said enough on this topic.

* Article 7

&gt;All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

Women are not equal before the law. I mentioned it above under Article 3, but once again, it is blatantly clear that women are not treated as equals under the law. Not only are they completely unrepresented in the Saudi Arabian government, even the Royal women have barely any power. With a court system, law enforcement system, army, and executive system all run by men, I would find it very hard to believe that they are given equal protection or treatment under the law. The simple fact that it is completely legal for a man to kill his wife with "proper reason" is evidence enough for this point.

* Article 9

&gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.

I'm not even going to bother to explain this one myself, and I will instead leave you with [this](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30744693?ocid=socialflow_twitter), [this](http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-executes-54-people-in-first-3-months-of-2015-588431.html), and [this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siti-zainab-saudi-arabia-beheads-mentally-ill-female-domestic-worker-angering-indonesia-1496492).

* Article 10

&gt;Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.

I'm losing steam writing about this, so I'll leave you with a few quotes to prove my point:

&gt;Western-based human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa, as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia. These include the number of executions, the range of offenses which are subject to the death penalty, the lack of safeguards for the accused in the criminal justice system, the treatment of homosexuals, the use of torture, the lack of religious freedom, and the highly disadvantaged position of women. The Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House have also reported that "Saudi Arabia's practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law."

&gt;Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. Decisions are made without juries and usually by a single judge.

* Article 13

&gt;(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

Saudi woman require permission from the head of the house (husband, father, or male relative) to leave the country. They can be sequestered in their own homes and forbidden from leaving, returning, or any number of things that would restrict their movement. I quoted this above, but it is also relevant here:

&gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her "guardian", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.

* Article 16

&gt;(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.

Every single god damn right in Article 13 is utterly non-existant for the women of Saudi Arabia. They do NOT have equal rights during marriage, as a women has to go through the highly biased court systems to achieve a divorce whereas a man need only say, "On this day I have divorced you." They certainly do not marry with consent, teenage girls often marrying 55 or 60 year old men, maybe even older than their own father. And if you think that the family is protected under the law, from, say, a father threatening to execute his daughter for "indecency", then I advise you look into exactly how that doesn't happen.

* Article 18

&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

Saudi Arabia has a de jure restriction on the right of freedom of religion, as the only allowed religion is Sunni Islam, and Sunni Islam alone. No other denominations of Islam or ANY OTHER RELIGION are allowed to be practiced. Anyone marrying a Saudi citizen or attempting to be a Saudi national MUST convert to Islam, with no exceptions. 

* Article 19

&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Censoring of the media, of the press, and of the basic expression of thought through speech are all restricted heavily in Saudi Arabia. No further explanation is needed, simply look at the first article linked above under Article 9.

* Article 20

&gt;(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.

The second point above is infringed on; by being forced to convert to Islam, you are also being forced to join the mosque and participate in practices such as praying at the specified times and observing religious customs as part of the mosque...unless you're a woman, in which case I don't believe that you are allowed in a mosque. But I may be wrong about this.

* Article 21

&gt;(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
(2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.
(3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.

They are a monarchy and a theocracy, breaking point three of Article 21. Women are allowed no representation in the government, breaking point one in Article 21. I don't believe there is a such thing as public service in Saudi Arabia, so point two can be entirely disregarded in this case.

* Article 23

&gt;(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.
(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.
(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.
(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.

Women DO NOT have the inherent right to work, nor the right to even have an education so that they might one day work. In the case of equal pay, women simply not being allowed to work takes care of that issue right there. Point three of Article 23 can be entirely ignored under these circumstances, and point 4 is entirely untrue in Saudi Arabia, as I doubt the poor laborers have ever heard of the word "union" used in that context.

* Article 26

&gt;(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.
(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION. Again and again this will surface. Women are extremely restricted in all manner of ways, violating their basic rights as human beings. Furthermore, the one-sided Islamic based education that people are allowed to go through in Saudi Arabia is little more than indoctrination of the falsifications that have plagued the bastardized version of Islam all too many people think is the true interpretation of the religion!

Finally, I have finished cataloging all of their violations of ONLY the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was **established by the UN itself** and is being **broken by one of it's main members**. If this isn't grounds for removal, I don't know what is.

I know Saudi Arabia is a large economic player, is one of the founding members of several Arab confederates and alliances, as well as a major player in OPEC, but by sending our (United States) President to that country, allowing them to serve in the United Nations, an organization committed to stopping violence and promoting fairness and equality, and maintaining an allied relationship with them is not only hypocritical, it is morally wrong. I don't see how one could argue that they shouldn't be removed from the United Nations, nor can I see how one could justify ANY of the actions or laws listed above.

If you want to change my mind, I'd be open to listening to the economic, geo-political, and military perspectives of this argument, but if you insist on arguing morality here, I'm open to hearing it.

Thank you in advance for reading and responding thoughtfully!

EDIT2: THANK YOY FOR GETTING ME TO THE FRONT PAGE OF CMV!!!

And thank you for all the thoughtful responses. I'm in school right now but when I get home I will respond to ALL of them, I promise!

EDIT3: The overwhelming response to this post has been absolutely enlightening and very educational. I'd like to especially thank /u/Omega037, /u/tropical_chancer, /u/GTFErinyes, /u/GnosticTemplar, /u/crankypants15, and /u/mr-tibbs for providing excellent points and countering my arguments very eloquently. These were true counter-arguments and not only gave me additional information, but were good rhetoric and made me think twice about my stance. I'm going to leave this thread open, as I'm hoping that I'll get additional replies as well thought out as the ones below, but I will be closing this thread at 12:00 PST because everyone here has practically changed my view on the issue. 

Thanks, everyone!

I agree with many of his policies, and believe that he is exactly the shock Washington needs to return to making progress as a society. He seems like the next FDR. However, many people believe he doesn't have the level of support necessary (I'd love to hear about the current opinion on this and see what chance he has).

Assuming he fails to get the nomination, it's a certainty (literally 100%, as far as I know. I'd be interested if there is any reason this would be wrong) that Hillary is the Democratic candidate. It's looking like Trump, to the GOP's horror, will be the Republican. Obviously he's super crazy but none of the other candidates have any passionate supporters.

The obvious second choice to Bernie is Hillary. Personally I don't think she's a good choice. She seems dishonest and misleading, and changes her views too often. She also seems too connected to various businesses who exchange money with her. I also don't like a lot of her policies (death penalty, marijuana (although I don't use it and don't plan to, I think it should be an individual's choice), Middle Eastern interactions, etc). She doesn't feel like a *person*, if that makes sense. She seems like she sees herself as "I need to uphold my contributors, who are the most important American people", in contrast to my belief that in a democratic system (which may be un-ideal, but it's what we've got so it's what we should operate our policies in) policies should be made to benefit the largest number of people possible, regardless of those people's traits. Minorities (and I don't mean racial minorities, regardless of how often people mean that when they use the word) also need to be supported. Hillary would be unremarkable and would not distinctly alter American society.

In contrast, I believe Trump would make voters realize the absurdity of his views very quickly. He would not get a second term, and I think voter turnout would be higher because of people realizing "Man, we messed up in 2016, let's not let that happen again". By having an extremist like Trump, I think there would be a strong backlash toward Sanders-esque growth. Sanders' success so far would mean that a candidate with similar views would be more able to feel confident in garnering support. In essence, I think that by electing Trump, you're accepting 4 years of hell, but after those years we would get stronger, better growth for the country as a whole. Am I wrong here?

Ideally this process should be conducted via polygraph, even though it is not 100% accurate.  People could apply for a re-test.

For example:

[62%](http://www.webcitation.org/5xkMGAEvY) of British Muslims do not believe in the protection of free speech; Only 3% adopt a "consistently pro-freedom of speech line."

[62%](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/01/strong-support-for-shariah-in-canada) of Muslims in Canada support Islamic law.

According to an interpretation of this study, approximately [45%](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) of Sharia supporters surveyed worldwide disagreed with the idea that Islamic law should apply only to Muslims.

A [survey](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/12/12/muslim-women-win) of Muslim women in Paris suburbs found that three-quarters of them wear their masks out of fear - including fear of violence.

[65%](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4092/europe-islamic-fundamentalism) of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in.

[Large majorities](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) of Muslims favor Sharia.  Among those who do, stoning women for adultery is favored by 89% in Pakistanis, 85% in Afghanistan, 81% in Egypt, 67% in Jordan, ~50% in 'moderate' Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, 58% in Iraq, 44% in Tunisia, 29% in Turkey, and 26% in Russia.

Those favoring the death penalty for [apostasy](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) (leaving the Islamic religion) include 86% in Egypt, 82% in Jordan, 42% in Iraq, 76% in Pakistan, 62% in Malaysia, 18% in moderate Indonesia, and more.

[1 in 3](http://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/survey-on-islam-in-austria-18-of-muslims-support-death-sentence-for-apostasy-21-9-oppose-democracy/) Muslims in Austria say it is not possible to be a European and a Muslim.  22% oppose democracy.

[1 in 3](http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/ShariaLawOrOneLawForAll.pdf) Muslims in the UK strongly agree that a wife should be forced to obey her husband's bidding.

[43%](http://rt.com/news/208387-austria-islam-kindergarten-muslim/) of Islamic teachers in Austria openly advocate Sharia law over democracy.

[Honor killing](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) the woman for sex outside of marriage is favored over honor killing the man in almost every Islamic country.  Over half of Muslims surveyed believed that honor killings over sex were at least partially justified.

America and the West pride themselves on how free we are compared to other nations, but we don't seem very concerned that we may be largely expanding populations who disagree with fundamental human rights.  These numbers are indicative of a failed system of immigration and assimilation.

There's more to radical Islam than simply the threat of terrorism.  There absolutely is a clash of civilizations, and we have to come to terms with that and try to encourage secularization worldwide and especially at home more than ever today.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>15</id><identifier>1klwr1</identifier><title>I believe no crime deserves the death penalty. Cmv</title><commentCount>163</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1klwr1/i_believe_no_crime_deserves_the_death_penalty_cmv/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>To make things clear due to several people not just one. I have changed my mind. In the case where their is reasonable doubt that this person will kill again the death penalty is acceptable.

The main reasons I do not believe in the death penalty are as follows.

Mistakes can be made regarding who is guilty. No matter how certain the evidence there is a chance that the person is still innocent.

Who has the right to decide that this person must die.

Execution does nothing but make people feel better, at the ultimate expense of someone else.

Does someone deserve to die if they feel true and ultimate remorse?

We can not accurately decipher the insane people from the sane.

A death penalty trial costs on average of two million dollars around the same as a 40 year prison stay.

The people who sentence people to death don't carry out the act themselves. it is easy to say this person deserves to die, but how many of them would be willing to inject someone.

A death sentence doesn't just affect the person receive but the family, friends and community of the the condemned person.

The reasons for the crime will never be fully understood by the jury, they can not decipher fact from fiction or understand the mind of the criminal.

Many people are put to death for crimes with a virtually 0% chance to re offend. (A political crime or treason.)

Opinions can be warped from media propaganda, and the prosecutor.

What happens when you are wrong?</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>16</id><identifier>2hsd0n</identifier><title>CMV: Any country, state, city, etc. which legalizes the death penalty should legalize euthanasia.</title><commentCount>161</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2hsd0n/cmv_any_country_state_city_etc_which_legalizes/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Before I begin, I want to state that I don't want any devil's advocates as this is a very serious CMV. If you disagree with what I have to say, I will assume that you yourself personally disagree with what I have to say.

So it has just occurred to me that there are many places in the world that *still* condones killing people if they commit a horrible enough crime as deemed by their laws. 

However I researched euthanasia and death penalty laws and realized despite many countries and states allowing killing of (biologically) healthy human beings for crimes as deemed by society, these same places that would kill a human being against his/her will because of crimes as deemed by law are unwilling to allow healthy human beings to kill themselves legally if they wanted to. 

I'm sorry, but if countries and states don't give a damn that they are killing human beings - even if the human being commits a "horrible" crime, what is wrong with (biologically) healthy individuals killing themselves if they so choose?

I know what people are going to say as a knee-jerk reaction: "Well we shouldn't kill good people because we should help them instead." Yeah, we should, but we don't. We say that but we don't mean it because the action that should be taken to help good people aren't being taken. It is just all bark and no bite.

There are millions of homeless people, depressed people, people who don't get to eat meals everyday, etc who would rather just end it all because they see their life going nowhere. We aren't really helping them: we walk past the homeless people, pretending they're not there. We tell the depressed person to "suck it up and deal with it" so we don't care. We pretend we care about people living in poverty by donating to a charity every few years or so when an advertisement tells us we need to care and then forget about it. The truth is, we don't care. Or we care so little that it only affects us as an afterthought and then we just forget it all. So we don't care - at least not enough.

Just [on Reddit alone](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/) there are many people wishing they could just end it. They have not committed any crimes but they don't really enjoy living, so why not allow them to end it if they so desire? - especially if the land you are living in has laws that allow the death penalty to occur for criminals?

If a society can allow a biologically healthy criminal to die via death penalty method because he commits a crime, I think this same society should allow a biologically healthy citizen who hasn't broken the law to die. - especially considering society doesn't actually care enough about the well being of these people who want to kill themselves: the homeless, people who are depressed, those in poverty and those who just don't find any meaning in their lives, etc.

I hear people say people who kill themselves are selfish. Well let me give another perspective. It has occurred to me that societies that ban suicide and euthanasia and yet refuses to help those who feel that way are even more selfish because they want to feel morally righteous about not allowing people to kill themselves and yet they are unwilling to help these same people with problems that lead these people to not want to live. Even worse for those places which allow the death penalty and yet bans euthanasia. 

If we are unwilling to implement policies on a societal level that deals with people who feel worthless and unhappy, or hate their lives for whatever reason then why not just allow these people the decision to end it all? 

I am willing to change my view if someone gives me good reasons. Thanks!

<submission><id>17</id><identifier>3w4yy0</identifier><title>CMV: Committing a cruel or abusive act against an animal should carry the same penalty as committing that act against another human</title><commentCount>150</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3w4yy0/cmv_committing_a_cruel_or_abusive_act_against_an/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Currently, acts of abuse against animals are typically punished with a much less sever sentence than acts of abuse against humans.  I don't believe that this is morally acceptable.  For example, if I were to put a human baby in the oven and cook it to death and I were convicted for this crime, I would almost certainly face at least 25 years in prison, but much more likely I would face life or the death sentence.  If I were to commit the exact same act, but put a puppy in the oven instead, I would probably get a fine for a few thousand dollars, maybe some community service, and in the most extreme case I might face a year in prison or so.  I've never heard of anyone getting more than 5 years in prison for animal abuse.

This seems deeply unjust to me.  Whether the creature being tortured is a human or a dog, both would experience incredible pain and trauma.  Both are innocent victims, and both have the potential to contribute to society.  An argument I often hear in response to this is that humans have much more potential to contribute to society.  However, this does not change my view, because humans also have much more potential to make negative contributions to society (humans can grow up to become terrorists; dogs can't, for example).  Therefore, it is unfair to assume that the human will contribute to society more than the dog would.

Another argument that I often hear is that animals are not as intelligent as humans, therefore their lives are less important.  I believe that this belief is due to a bias in humans towards themselves.  We are the most intelligent animals on the planet; that makes it awfully convenient that we decided intelligence is the metric to base a life's worth on.  It's like the tallest person in the room claiming that "Tall people's lives are most important", or the oldest in the room claiming "Old people's lives are most important".  We are the most intelligent species on the planet, claiming "Intelligent creatures are most important".

Finally, another argument I often hear has to do with the factory farming industry.  I eat meat (I won't deny it).  However, I feel that there is a huge difference because of the necessity.  If you inflict pain on a creature for no reason whatsoever, that is very different from killing it for food.  Also, I hold the farming industry to the same standards I hold people to.  If a farm is causing unnecessary pain to an animal, then I believe it should be treated the same as a human causing unnecessary pain.  However, I do not condemn a farm that treats their animals humanely, and makes their deaths as quick and painless as possible.

I'm interested in hearing other thoughts on this.  CMV!

Yet some people persist in claiming that institutional racism is gone. So I thought I would compile some evidence.



# Economics

## Wealth/housing

One area where we can see this is with wealth. The median black family has [*twenty times*](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth-gaps-rise-to-record-highs-between-whites-blacks-hispanics/) less wealth than the average white family. Much of this disparity is the result of institutionalized housing discrimination, called "redlining." 2011 [research](http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf) from Brandeis university found that:

&gt; The number of years families owned their homes was the largest predictor of the gap in wealth growth by race (Figure 2). Residential segregation by government design has a long legacy in this country and underpins many of the challenges African-American families face in buying homes and increasing equity. There are several reasons why home equity rises so much more for whites than African-Americans:

&gt; * Because residential segregation artificially lowers demand, placing a forced ceiling on home equity for AfricanAmericans
who own homes in non-white neighborhoods6
;

&gt;* Because whites are far more able to give inheritances or family assistance for down payments due to historical
wealth accumulation, white families buy homes and start acquiring equity an average eight years earlier than black
families7
;

&gt; * Because whites are far more able to give family financial assistance, larger up-front payments by white homeowners
lower interest rates and lending costs; and
&gt; * Due to historic differences in access to credit, typically lower incomes, and factors such as residential segregation,
the homeownership rate for white families is 28.4 percent higher than the homeownership rate for black families

This discrimination is a product of government policy. Boston University historian David Lyons [explains](http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=twlj) that: 

&gt; In fact, federal policies promoted racial segregation. Consider
housing. In the 1930s, federal agencies embraced the practice of "redlining,"
which disqualifies applicants in African-American and "transitional"
neighborhoods from home purchase and home improvement In fact, federal policies promoted racial segregation. Consider
housing. In the 1930s, federal agencies embraced the practice of "redlining,"
which disqualifies applicants in African-American and "transitional"


The process of housing discrimination [continued on into the 1980's](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/opinion/sunday/housing-apartheid-american-style.html?_r=0).

## Jobs

* Identical job applications with "black-sounding names" get calls back [30% less](http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html) than white-sounding names.

* In bad economic periods, [black people are fired before other people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000014/)

* [Black workers receive extra scrutiny from bosses, which can lead to worse performance reviews, lower wages, and even job loss.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/why-black-workers-really-do-need-to-be-twice-as-good/409276/)


# Criminal "justice"

Black Americans are oppressed by our criminal justice system. 

* [White and black people use marijuana at the same rate, but black people about 3.5 times more likely to be arrested for it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/). 

* [White people are *more likely* to deal drugs, but black people are more likely to be arrested](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/)

* Crack cocaine (more common with black users) carries [harsher penalties](https://books.google.com/books?id=OxEVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22one+of+the+drug+war%27s+most+egregious+tactics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcjraCiPLNAhUSS2MKHXyGDyYQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22one%20of%20the%20drug%20war's%20most%20egregious%20tactics%22&amp;f=false) than powder cocaine (more common with white users). 

* For murders with white victims, black people get executed [15 times](https://www.aclu.org/race-and-death-penalty) more than white people, even though [82%](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/) of white victims are killed by white people.

***The end result of racism in criminal justice is that [America now incarcerates black people at a higher rate than Apartheid South Africa.](https://www.aclu.org/drug-war-new-jim-crow)*** 

# Voting

* Since 1982 and 2014, the Department of Justice overruled[ 2,400 racist voting laws/policies](http://www.lawyerscommittee.org/admin/voting_rights/documents/files/12-96bsUnitedStates.pdf) in 10 states. See examples [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf) pp. 46-48

* Voter ID laws disenfranchize [one in nine voters](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voter-id), disproportionately [black and hispanic](https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/naacp-v-steen).

* In 2006, the Supreme Court found that Texas drew legislative districts in order to [decrease minority voting power](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf).

With all of this research, no one should be able to claim that institutional racism doesn't exist.

I believe that a fetus is a human life. Not a *potential* life, or some other silly half measure. With that in mind, why should I want abortion to be a safe procedure for the mother? She is choosing to end the life of one of her children, and I'm supposed to be concerned about her? 

This isn't to say that I would wish death upon those who would have an abortion. I am against the death penalty, and I would prefer that the parents could be tried and punished/rehabilitated appropriately. However, I feel that making abortions dangerous discourages some who would otherwise seek them, and that benefit outweighs the loss of a few people who were killed in the act of getting an abortion.

As I reread this, I'm not completely happy with the clarity, so feel free to ask me to straighten things out. I know this view will seem cruel to many of you, but I wouldn't be on /r/changemyview if I was completely happy with it, so show me what you've got.</selfText></submission>

But this caveat raises the question of how we establish who is and isn't a rape victim, and I don't think a satisfying answer has been presented yet. Rape is one of the most under-reported crimes and one of the most difficult to prove. There's no standard we can apply in the real world that isn't going to screw over a significant fraction of rape victims. So while adding this caveat to the pro-life position makes it appear more palatable, it's no more tenable in reality than a position like "I support the death penalty except when the person turns out to be innocent."  The intellectually honest thing for a person to do if they're pro-life is to either drop the caveat and own the consequences of what that means or rethink their position.


**Edit:** I realized that I was a little too broad in my wording. I'm talking about pro-life positions that support illegalizing rather than putting a time limit on abortion.

Let's assume, for the purposes of this discussion, that the particular case in question showed incontrovertible evidence condemning the accused; say they murdered 50 people with a machine gun in front of a crowded stadium filled with people, caught on camera, etc. 

I believe that in these instances, capital punishment is absolutely justified and moral. I'm specifically looking for counter arguments holding that capital punishment is immoral in and of itself.

Edit: a word

Edit 2: To address a point that seems to be coming up a lot: I really do mean that what I'm talking about is the concept of a death penalty, not any specific application. I believe that the death of a person in certain circumstances is justifiable and moral *in and of itself*. To put it another way, I believe in the concept of "justified vengeance." Please limit your arguments to this concept, I'm not interested in debating the merits of the death penalty as it is in America in 2016. That has been talked about *to death*. (Spoiler: I'm *against* it, in nearly every application.)

Edit 3: Lots of good responses while I was sleeping, I'll try to address them later today. Thanks for your patience!</selfText></submission>

It would be immoral kill someone who is fixed of his or her fault and could not act on such fault ever again.  We don't know what the future holds and acting on something as valuable as life that has a permanent consequence is immoral.

<submission><id>23</id><identifier>1zga4d</identifier><title>I hate the idea of, "tough love", in every applicable sense, CMV</title><commentCount>139</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1zga4d/i_hate_the_idea_of_tough_love_in_every_applicable/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>We administer tough love when we're angry, as a way to act on that feeling without being called juvenile. For example, when a father catches his son smoking and makes him smoke a carton the father knows that his son is going to end up sick. He wants to see his son suffer, not for smoking, but for disobeying. Parents administer tough love when their kids are too old for a spanking and it's the only way they know how to discipline them, understandable but with the caveat that they'd also like to see their children fail and have to admit that they should've listened, which is counterproductive to a healthy parent-child relationship. 

In politics the right tends to advocate for tough love legislation, which I believe is also out of anger. This is where the abortion debate comes from, anger for women that have sex for any reason other than procreation, and advocation of punishment in the form of the pain and discomfort from being pregnant. There's no way Roe v. Wade is going anywhere and politicians know it, but since they feel women need to be controlled *somehow* they propose tough love and take away their assistance. Same thing with the death penalty, three strikes laws, war on drugs, and countless other proposals, they're a way to satisfy one's need to punish out of anger and claim that it deters others from following the example.

To me, tough love's motives speak loud and clear and is something that people need to be called out on. I would personally feel less-than if I gave anyone the opportunity to get their jollies off my suffering, especially for acting in ways they may not agree with but are socially acceptable nonetheless. But it goes to a point I made earlier, when someone administers tough love it means they're counting on you to fail, because if you don't they'll have to admit they were wrong. 

So to clarify my point: **Tough love is a lazy, counterproductive, and purposely aims at making problems worse rather than actually solving them. Those that use it only do so to punish indirectly, out of anger and a want for the recipients to fail.**</selfText></submission>

"Even the very wise cannot see all ends."

-[Gandalf the Grey](http://youtu.be/IrOqnZdvI6M)

The death penalty makes no sense in modern society. It is utterly irreversible, unlike most other penalties. It is impossible to know the long-term consequences of killing someone, so it is unlikely I will find utilitarian arguments to be convincing. Ultimately, it is a barbaric abrogation of the rights of every human that the state can mete out life and death at will.

<submission><id>25</id><identifier>26pm3o</identifier><title>CMV: Using a bullet to execute an inmate is no more barbaric than the other methods currently used, and that if America must have a death penalty, it should replace other methods of execution.</title><commentCount>131</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/26pm3o/cmv_using_a_bullet_to_execute_an_inmate_is_no/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I'm not looking to engage in a debate about the moral nature of execution, but rather the aspects of pecuniary cost and moral implications behind various methods of execution. 

Given that using a bullet to the back of the skull would neutralize the brain stem, the inmate would feel no pain. Furthermore, the cost of a bullet is low relative to a lethal injection cocktail. It costs approximately 34 cents to buy a single 9mm round. Comparatively, it costs roughly $1,300 per lethal cocktail.

Perhaps more importantly, it strikes a balance between cost and ethical forms of execution. Even if we all agree that the innate nature of execution is unequivocally immoral, the method by which we dispatch a prisoner to death is still important. Given the status quo, executions are not going anywhere. Therefore, using a single bullet to kill a prisoner seems far more attractive than the long, painful process of electrocution or hanging.

Finally, the issue of intimacy comes into play. Using a handgun to execute prisoners can be a personal affair, which weighs on the executioner's soul much more than other forms currently in use today. However, I argue that an automated system should be used. It further distances the human element from the execution, thus ensuring both precision and psychological sanctity.

<submission><id>26</id><identifier>4u5b66</identifier><title>CMV: If we must use the death penalty, the preferred method should be by hypoxia</title><commentCount>139</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4u5b66/cmv_if_we_must_use_the_death_penalty_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I believe that we shouldn't use the death penalty but I understand some people want to and they are welcome to that opinion. I'm not here to debate whether we should, just if we do, how we should. I think there are 3 main objectives in the death penalty and we should aim to maximise all 4, in this order:

1. Chance of killing the convict. If there is a slight chance they may survive the execution, it shouldn't be carried out. It causes undue torture to not only the convict but to the person carrying out the execution.

2. Painlessness to the convict. It is, after all, justice, not revenge. We are not executing people to torture them, but because they did something we agreed they should pay for with their life. We don't want to turn our justice systems into revenge killings. We've moved past that.

3. Mental trauma to the executioner. Someone ultimately has to be responsible for the death of the victim. Whether they have done horrendously vile crimes or not, they are still a human and ending their life will have at least some impact on the executioner. Most people would SAY they would be OK with killing a mass murdering paedophile, but if it came to it I believe most would think first, and think afterwards. Any way to cut down on this trauma is beneficial.

4. Cleanliness. Absolute obliteration causes essentially instant death with no pain or chance of survival. But it is gruesome, disgusting, and uncivil. We need to make the deaths as clean as possible, be it in blood, vomit, organs, whatever. It also has some effect on the executioner.


I'm British and we don't use the death penalty, and I'm glad of that, so for this CMV I will use the US as an example of a country that executes criminals. Currently in the US there are 5 legal methods of criminal execution;

* Lethal injection (most common)

* Electrocution in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia

* Gas inhalation in Arizona and California

* Hanging in Delaware and Washington

* Firing Squad in Utah

Lethal injections have long been known to cause issues, for example issues finding a vein can cause undue mental trauma for the convict. Furthermore failures in the exact protocol for executing people in this way can cause severe pain for the convict. This means that both point 2 and 3 from the before. It fails in these issues, so I don't believe it is perfect. Furthermore people have been known to survive long times after injection, when under pain.

Electrocution has fallen out of fashion for the exact reason that often times the convict survives the initial electrocution and must be shocked a further 1 or 2, possibly more times. This fails point 1, but furthermore it means the convict is in severe pain when they die. Instant electrocution could be OK if it killed you instantly, but as has been shown in history that isn't the case.

Gas inhalation is similar to my proposed method, but it has a serious difference. It introduces a poison into the body, instead of restricting oxygen. The poison works actively negatively on the body, rather than just passively. This means the convict is in pain, and often very much conscious to the pain they are in. Multiple accounts of people moaning, screaming and thrashing in pain have been recorded in US prisons. A prison warden even said he'd quit his job if they made him do another, meaning this fails points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of my above post.

Hanging isn't painless, convicts thrash about as they gasp for air. They can physically feel their windpipe restricted and consciously know of the danger they are in. Mere videos of real life hangings show people clawing their throats out to try and remove the rope from their neck. We see videos of people being hanger in places like ISIS controlled territory and say it is barbaric. We talk about it in revolutionary France, and pirates in the Caribbean (ha) and act like it is something from the past. But it is very much still an option in parts of the US. It's quite effective in killing convicts, but it is painful for no reason. Therefore it fails point 2, possibly 3.

Firing squads have never been massively popular, but they rely on there to be someone to physically shoot the convict. We try and cut down on firing squad trauma by using blanks, multiple shooters, etc... but it still means people are actively walking up to their convict, pulling the trigger, and watching them die. This plays on people's minds, regardless of whether they had a blank or not. It also creates unnecessary mess, adding more trauma and failing points 3 and 4. 

Now, hypoxia. We can cause this by using a sealed "tank" much like a gas chamber or similar room. The air is SLOWLY pumped from the room while people slowly lose consciousness, become euphoric and just drift into black. They pass out, and eventually they die from lack of oxygen. In slow and gradual decompression it is almost always painless, and people despite being conscious are totally unaware of the pain they should be in. Watch videos of people optionally going through decompression. They talk about how they knew they were going to die, but simply didn't care. They were just in a state where everything seemed somewhat confusing, but also OK. No pain, no chance of survival, no poison. Just a lack of oxygen, unconscious, dead.

It's clean, it causes little trauma to convict or executioner, and should therefore be the only method of execution used in any country that wishes to call themselves civilised.

<submission><id>27</id><identifier>4dgzo8</identifier><title>CMV: Someone who supports the abolishment of the death penalty cannot be pro-choice.</title><commentCount>126</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4dgzo8/cmv_someone_who_supports_the_abolishment_of_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I've been thinking about this topic a lot recently, especially after reading up on some of the Democratic presidential candidates views on both the death penalty and abortion. I find it strange that someone like Bernie Sanders can say that it is "wrong for a civilized nation like ours to condone killing human beings, even if they are convicted felons", yet he is a staunch pro-choicer and supporter of women's rights.

Now, I am a left-leaning libertarian. I am completely against the death penalty. I *want* to say that I am pro-choice, but something just irks me about that. I feel hypocritical if I say "I oppose the death penalty, but performing an abortion is okay". I am a staunch supporter of human rights, and I believe that all life is precious. Still, I acknowledge the fact that a baby cannot be created without *both* a sperm and an egg, and it must (at least for a little bit of time) be housed within the uterus. I believe that the woman has the right to choose what happens with her body and that the government should stay out of it. I think that she should have that *choice*, and I don't think that abortion should be made illegal.

That being said, I still struggle with this topic. Because I argue with myself: "well, if a woman should have a choice to kill the fetus inside her, shouldn't anyone have 'the choice' the kill any other human being?", "should we just make murder legal, too, then?", "What about the death penalty? Abortion is fine because it's a fetus, without the ability to communicate or make its own decisions? What about a convicted murderer, who has to stay locked up all day and can't exercise his other freedoms, and who took away the freedom of life from several other human beings? Should we just kill him because of that too?"

Can anyone help me understand how someone could be *both* pro-choice *and* against the death penalty? What arguments/evidence could I use to defend myself?

I do believe we shouldn't execute anyone if the person has any evidence that they are innocent, on the off chance they are not guilty. But there are cases that are blatantly obvious that the convict is guilty to what ever crime they committed. Those people should be killed off. 

The only other arguement that kinda makes sense to me is that it costs more money to kill them, then to keep them in jail. This could be considered a CMV part two, but to make it cheaper I think the death penalty nationwide should be similar to Utah, I think firing squad should be the only form of execution as to how cheap it is to administer. </selfText></submission>

According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter), some cases of voluntary manslaughter involve an intent to kill that is tempered by mitigating circumstances. I am not discussing those cases in this post. The cases I am interested in are those that involve no intent to kill: Voluntary manslaughter where the intent was to cause serious harm but not death and the various forms involuntary manslaughter. 

There is a fundamental difference between manslaughter and most other crimes that I can think of (If you can think of any that are like manslaughter, then I probably have a problem with them as well): manslaughter criminalizes the consequences of an individual’s actions rather than the actions themselves. An individual can perform the exact same actions twice in indistinguishable circumstances, but get unlucky one of those times and accidentally kill someone. In the case where no one died, that individual might be charged with reckless endangerment, criminal assault/battery, etc… or even nothing at all depending on the action. In the case where someone died, that individual would be charged with the same crime in addition to manslaughter. In New York, a conviction of First Degree Reckless Endangerment for a first time felony offender has no minimum sentence and a maximum sentence of 7 years in prison (http://www.new-york-lawyers.org/reckless-endangerment.html). A conviction of  second-degree manslaughter carries a sentence of 3 to 15 years in prison (http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-involuntary-manslaughter-laws.html). This means that in two cases where identical reckless actions are performed, the maximum sentence could be 3 times as long (7 max in the first case, 22 max in the second case) if someone gets killed. This difference is essentially entirely a matter of luck.

A good example is that of drunk driving. If two different people are who are equally inebriated both decide to make a 12 mile drive at rush hour in New York, but one hits and kills a pedestrian and the other is stopped by the police, they face very different consequences. The penalty for a DUI in New York is up to a year in jail for the first offense (http://dui.drivinglaws.org/newyork.php). The penalty for killing someone while under the influence (vehicular manslaughter in the first degree) is up to 15 years (http://www.madd.org/laws/law-overview/Vehicular_Homicide_Overview.pdf). Is it reasonable to punish these two identical actions with completely different sentences because the consequences were different in the two cases? Shouldn’t the actions that the offender has control over be subject to judicial actions rather than the consequences of those actions.

Note: I have class and work now, so I’ll be back in the evening.

Edit: Having read the comments, I've decided that the DUI example is too complicated -- it involves a continuous action and too many variables, so consider this example from one of my responses instead:

&gt;Imagine that someone in New York throws a brick out of a 10th story window onto Broadway without looking. Another person a block down does the same thing at the same time. The first brick hits the ground harmlessly, while the second brick hits a person in the head, killing them. I'm having trouble finding a law on defenestration on Google, but I imagine the first case would qualify as reckless endangerment, while the second case would qualify as reckless endangerment and as manslaughter. I described the corresponding sentences in the OP. Do you think that these two people should be charged differently?

--

If capital punishment is to be carried out, it is supposed to be carried out in the most humane way possible. I feel that the current methods do not fulfill this requirement. The main reason behind my thinking is that, when looking at each method of capital punishment there are ways it can be botched. It would take a while to go through each one, but some examples are:

Lethal Injection: injection of a muscle can cause extreme pain, wrong dosages of medication can cause patients to be unable to move, but still feel the pain
Electrocution: First charge of electricity failing to kill
Gas Chamber: Death due to slow asphyxiation instead of passing out from gas.

This [link](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions?scid=8&amp;did=478) shows many examples of botched executions that have occurred in the United States. I feel like there are way too many examples, especially when you consider the number of inmates that are executed a year. These botched executions lead to immense pain and suffering for the clients. 

**I don't want to discuss whether or not the death penalty is morally just or under what type of crimes it should be granted.** The question here is whether or not any of the current methods of legal execution (Lethal Injection, Electrocution, Gas Chamber, Firing Squad, Hanging) can be considered humane. My current belief is that due to all the complications, that can and do occur, there is currently no method.

<submission><id>32</id><identifier>4du1rv</identifier><title>CMV: The primary method of capital punishment should be death by gunshot</title><commentCount>112</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4du1rv/cmv_the_primary_method_of_capital_punishment/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>**Let me start this off by establishing the following:**

* I support capital punishment for crimes that deserve it **(this is not the view that I am arguing or trying to change)**

* This view is for the United States. I don't really care what other countries do. As for which state, it is for any state that has death penalty laws.

* When I state "death by gunshot", I mean 1 executioner and 1 gun (live ammunition). Not a firing squad (multiple people).

* This is all assuming that the criminal is guilty without a reasonable doubt.

Currently, most executions (death penalties) are done through the method of lethal injections. I am aware of some states that have multiple methods, some of which allow the criminal to choose, but I disagree with all of them as well (electricity / gas inhalation / firing squad / etc.) I believe that the best way to execute would be a simple bullet to the head.

The following arguments are against lethal injection, but if needed to I can elaborate on why gunshot &gt; the current methods.

I've heard before (no sources, sorry, but I'm sure someone can dig it up) that lethal injections cost more than keeping someone for life in prison (this may be completely incorrect, but does not invalidate the following argument). That's honestly pretty silly. If executions were carried out with 1 executioner firing a shot (a rifle preferably, to be sure) at the criminal at a close enough range such that missing is virtually impossible, it would be the most efficient. The only cost would be the few cents that the cartridge of ammunition was worth (also, you have to pay the executioner, but isn't that already a cost with lethal injections?).

Lethal injections also take too much time. Why go through the process of strapping the person in place, inserting needles, injecting chemicals one at a time, and then waiting, and then removing the body? You can simply just shoot them in the head and maybe get some mess but obviously you'd put them in an area where clean-up and body transportation would be very easy.

It makes no difference for the person that's about to die. They are going to die anyways. It's pretty quick too.

As for why not firing squad, instead of having multiple people firing blanks with only 1 true shot, it should just be one person. Why waste the resources of gathering a bunch of people? It shouldn't be hard to find an executioner who will blow off someones head for money. Hell, I'd do that job. A machine that does this would be even more efficient, but the cost may not be worth it.

Executing someone by firearm straight to the head is by far more efficient than death by lethal injections.

<submission><id>33</id><identifier>27869d</identifier><title>CMV: Reddit's attitude and response to people being killed when they commit a crime is not only creepy but indicative of why America has such massive social problems</title><commentCount>110</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/27869d/cmv_reddits_attitude_and_response_to_people_being/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Whenever there is a post or video that shows someone, normally a burglar, being shot by a homeowner the response in the comments is normally at best: "It sucks that someone died, but they forfeited their lives the moment they broke into the house". At worse and quite often this attitude can lose the first part of the sentence and end up, if not exactly celebrating the death then at least saying it was no bad thing. While it is important to acknowledge that Reddit is not one entity and so has a varied opinion it seems that the top voted comment is consistently of this view and so can be extrapolated to present a majority opinion. If we want further proof the popularity of justice porn, which brings with it the same views and attitudes to the people being beaten up or otherwise hurt. 

My problem with this is this take on human relationships is it revolves around the idea that the people who commit crimes or act immorally deserve punishment. It is sometimes acknowledged that the punishment is disproportionate, but I would go even further and say the idea of punishment does not make much sense. The people who rob and steal do so because of factors outside their control: namely social factors and to a lesser extent their genetics. Crime is tightly linked to inequality and poverty, it comes about when a society is failing its people. This is not even an argument that people might be stealing not out of greed but of necessity, although that might be the case, but that even if they *are* stealing out of greed it is only because society tells them that is right.

Never in the comment sections is there mention of trying to improve the lives of people, which would almost certainly prevent the situation in the first place. It is this view that allows for the terrible prison system in the US. Reddit likes to talk about the Drug War being the root of the problem (which I agree is **an** issue, just not **the** issue) but often overlooks the aim of the prison system in America. The American prison system is there to punish those who commit crimes, with the idea of "justice being served" at the heart. The aim of prisons should be to rehabilitate instead of punish. It is only in the most extreme cases, where rehabilitation is simply not possible, that a prison should act as nothing but a way to keep the very dangerous separate from the general populace. It is the attitude towards punishment and the idea that people deserve what they get that allows for the death penalty in America, which to me is immoral beyond words.

If we take the news and Reddit to give an accurate view of America then it appears that the American people are far more concerned with their own rights than they are with helping others. The arguments surrounding possible gun control are always based around the rights of the people. Few people want to talk about how to reduce inequality, improve mental health care or improve education. When there is greater talk about what rights the people should have, as in negative freedom, over what responsibilities the people and state have to one another, as in positive freedom, you get the results seen in America.

<submission><id>34</id><identifier>2055ga</identifier><title>I believe that in general, Republicans are hypocrites. CMV!</title><commentCount>108</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2055ga/i_believe_that_in_general_republicans_are/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>First I want to start out by saying that I don’t think all Republicans are hypocritical, but I believe in general, they are. I also want to say that I understand Democrats have their fair share of problems as well, but that is a whole other discussion.

Why do I think Republicans are hypocrites? Well here are just a few examples:

1. This is the big one for me. Republicans claim that they are the party of small government, and that government should get out of people’s lives. However, if those people are two adult males that want to get married, a guy who wants to smoke weed, a woman who wants to have an abortion, or even someone who wants to pull their SO off life support, then all of a sudden, they believe that government should intervene. Not to mention the invasion of privacy and spying on US citizens that they frequently support.

2. Republicans claim that they are fervent about cutting spending and reducing the deficit. However, they refuse to cut military spending (despite spending more on defense than the countries with the next 10 highest defense budgets combined), subsidies to oil companies, etc. And they have no problem giving tax cuts to the rich regardless of how much it adds to the deficit.

3. Republicans often oppose same-sex marriage for different reasons, but usually it is because it goes against their values, it ruins the sanctity of marriage, etc. However, they never argue that premarital sex, divorce, or extramarital sex should be illegal even though all of those things are much more prevalent “sins” and they also “ruin the sanctity of marriage”. They have no problem discriminating other people, as long as it doesn't apply to them.  

4. This is similar to number 1, but Republicans claim that they heavily support states’ rights, but when those states legalize marijuana, same-sex marriage, give women access to safe abortions, or do anything else they don't like, they want the federal government to outlaw whatever the state is legalizing outright. 

5. Republicans claim that they are pro-life because “every life is precious” even if they are just an embryo. But when it comes to people who are already born, [they literally cheer for the death penalty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocKFSLsZnUo). (I understand that this one is not necessarily representative of most Republicans, but it is hypocritical nonetheless)

These are just a few examples that come to mind. There are many more.

I’d like to believe that Republicans are simply a group of people that I disagree with politically. Please change my view. </selfText></submission>

But from a moral perspective, the politicians who oppose single payer healthcare are committing a crime against Americans *at least* as bad as treason or first degree murder, on a massive scale.

First of all, Americans pay twice as much for healthcare as other advanced industrialized nations.  We spend 17% of our GDP on heatlhcare, as opposed to 9% in the UK which has the NHS.  

Many people who have health insurance are still afraid to go to the doctor because they might not be able to afford the copay.  

The incentive of for-profit healthcare to keep people sick and then treat symptoms rather then preventing illnesses and diseases before they start.

This is insane and immoral looting by the medical industrial complex, who are extracting obscene rents from the rest of the population.

The medical industrial complex and the politicians who oppose single payer healthcare are aggressively robbing the American people of trillions of dollars, health, freedom, dignity, the respect  of the rest of the world, the opportunity cost of everything else we could be doing with those resources, and they are diminishing respect for the rule of law and justice.

That is at least as bad as first degree murder and/or treason.  

Therefore, politicians who oppose single payer healthcare deserve the death penalty, even though they are not ostensibly in violation of any particular law on the books.

<submission><id>36</id><identifier>297z0w</identifier><title>CMV: Islam's rapid growth is a terrible thing, a bad influence, and threatens the progress we have worked so hard to achieve</title><commentCount>103</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/297z0w/cmv_islams_rapid_growth_is_a_terrible_thing_a_bad/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Hi Reddit,

Let me preface by saying that I am against discrimination against anyone for their race or religion. I would not be in favour of a law that advocates for the discrimination, exclusion, genocide, etc. of Muslims from public discourse as I see no ethical way of doing so. I believe the religion, not the people, should be eliminated and of course I see that as impossible. 

Moreover, I have many friends and even family members who are Muslim and love them very much as people. I also don't blame many who are raised muslim and remain so due to social ties, indoctrination, etc. as I find it kind of sad. Indeed I often don't understand how some of the brilliant, fun, open-minded individuals I am friends with still identify as Muslim. 

However, I absolutely abhor the religion. I have read the Quran and find it to be a mound of contradictions (the bible and torah are as well but nowhere near as downright violent and hateful as the Quran). I have spoken to my Muslim friends and family alike (I am an agnostic atheist) and they tend to cherrypick verses from the Quran to attempt to "prove wrong" some of my points. 

They justify seeing women as worth testifying as half of a man ("well we know how women nature is, they like to gossip and exaggerate, Islam doesn't deny human nature and is realist not idealist"). They justify misogyny ("We don't deny how men are naturally. Men are indeed very weak creatures who need us to put them on a pedestal. Women are strong because we are not afraid to show subordination in order to keep things going" or "covering our hair is doing a service to them, it is how we acknowledge that they are weak creatures who, unlike us, simply can't control themselves when in lust and lust more after appearances") I bring up the verses that talk about death to infidels and apostates and they respond with the cherrypicked "you have your religion, I have my religion" and the anti-coercion verses. Yet they fail to realize that if their book was indeed the word of God, then there wouldn't be any contradictions!

I am not a fan of Christianity or any religion for that matter, but I believe that Islam has had a disproportionately negative influence. Yes, Christians push their views on others. Yes, sometimes they kill for it. Yes, they are homophobic too, they are anti-choice and sometimes misogynistic. The difference is that Christians, for the most part, don't make women cover their head, don't have issues with work outside the home, advocate that people LOVE everyone, including infidels (as opposed to the muslims who hate infidels because the Quran decries and insults them). 

So what negative influence has Islam had? In short, they are bringing society backward. Their mindset is stuck in the medieval age, or maybe as some say the 7th century. Sure, Mohammed might have been a feminist for his time, but seriously get with the program, it's 1400 years later, the world turns and progresses, why are you stuck on your backwards ideology?

In list-form, the negatives are:

1. They put men on a pedestal, give women less rights - i.e. control where they go, who they are with, make sure genders don't mix, restrict opportunities, force them to cover up, sometimes mutilate them so they can't experience sexual pleasure, they make their testimony be worth half that of a man, etc. This comes at a time where women's rights are making leaps and bounds in a positive direction. 

2. They try to push their views on everyone in the area and if they don't, they are punished severely (i.e. persecutions of Christians and Jews in the Middle East). This comes at a time where we are increasing our tolerance for other types of people. 

3. They don't let people just believe what they want and [most believe in killing apostates](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/04/daily-chart-20). This comes at a time when people are becoming more open-minded about differing beliefs. 

4. Violence. They believe it's okay to be violent in pursuit of their ultimate goal - i.e. the ends justify the means. They are so busy fighting each other (shia vs. sunni), fighting other cultures (christians, Israel, etc.) Martyrdom is honoured and - for pete's sake - they're handing out candy in Palestine for abducting children and the mother of a suspect said she'd be PROUD if it were her son who kidnapped the Israeli boys. How is this ever okay? It doesn't matter what Israel did or did not do, the actions of Muslim countries and attitudes towards Israel are unacceptable and disproportionately brutal. Muslim society gets away with murder when the world should be fighting back and letting them know their crazy antics are not okay. How can we just let them do their stupid barbaric violent nonsense? Indeed, tens of thousands of terror attacks were committed worldwide by Muslims in the name of Islam, mostly against other Muslims. This comes at a time in history that is less violent than ever and getting even less violent. 

5. They have laws that favour them as opposed to outsiders (dhimmis) and give them extra perks - at a time when we are increasing equality and getting rid of laws that give privilege to one religion over another. 

6. Homophobia. They are virulently homophobic - all the countries that make homosexuality punishable by death are Muslim and cite Islamic law - at a time when gay rights are finally being taken seriously as civil rights. 

7. They are against free speech. if someone ever so much as makes fun of or insults islam they are punishable by death in Islamic countries. In non-Islamic countries (e.g. the Mohamed cartoon), people are trying to kill them for martyrdom and clerics are issuing fatwas on their lives. This comes at a time when the importance of free speech is recognized now more than ever. 

8. They're totally cool with youth marriage. Again, refusing to give women any agency - they're property, chattel, etc. I don't care about references to Khadija, she's obviously the exception, not the norm. 

9. Islamic society is all about conformity, and opposes innovation. Can you count on one hand the number of Muslims who have won the Nobel Prize for innovation in a field that isn't "Peace"? Nope? That's because there are only [four of them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Muslim_Nobel_laureates). Out of one and a half billion muslims. Contrast that with Jews who form 0.18% of the world population and [won nearly one quarter of all Nobel Prizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates), and [Atheists who have won 67 Nobel Prizes](http://philosopedia.org/index.php?title=Nobel_Prize_Winners#Nonbelievers_Who_Received_the_Nobel_Prize). This comes at a time that has seen the greatest innovation in history and the trend continues.

10. Islam denies many scientific tenets that go against their holy scripture. This comes at a time when we are trying to increase scientific literacy. 

I could go on. 

"But those who are doing all those things are not being real muslims!"

Have you even read the Quran? It's a pretty brutal book. I don't care about the "context of the time," when a book is that brutal maybe you should abandon it? And how do you justify that the majority of Muslim cultures in the world interpret Sharia that way (all the above reasons are applicable to the majority of Muslim countries)? 

"Islam is actually more feminist than common society because we want people to judge us by our personality and intelligence not our looks, and hijab does that"
Then why do you cake on so much damn makeup? No but seriously, it is just another way of showing that a woman's worth is in her virginity/purity and taking more choice away from the woman. It also justifies men doing bad bad things "I raped her because she deserved it because she wasn't in hijab!" Telling men they can't control themselves produces men who don't bother trying. 

"It's the culture, not the religion!"
The culture and religion are so intermeshed in Islamic society that you can't tease them apart. Therefore the culture has BECOME the religion and vice versa.

"We understand the nature of men and women and have these rules as recognition of divine understanding of biological reality."
 Saying men can't control themselves and that they are weak and have to be put on a pedestal and made to feel like they can control women so that peace can be kept, IMO, is a frequent theme of religion, particularly bad in Islam, and tends to create a self-fulfilling prophesy. It also allows men to get away with all kinds of crazy stuff and blame their biology. 

"But I just KNOW its the Truth" 
Ummmm.... how? I don't get it. How can you just assume something is the truth without any legitimate evidence beyond one source. And "I can just feel it" doesn't cut it for me either. 

Just because it's a different culture doesn't mean they get a free pass to do whatever BS they want and believe whatever BS they want.

Yes I am an islamophobe as I am petrified of the religion and the impact it is having on the world - not because I believe in discriminating against muslims. It has brought nothing but violence, hatred, and injustice. They justify bad things in the name of their god because its what "god wants them to do." Islam is the big bully on the playground and is only getting stronger as the fastest growing religion in the world. Am I not the only one who finds that super scary?

Are they the religion of peace? Well, I know Muslims claim they find peace in their lives being so predetermined - if they do x, y, and z they go to heaven. It's a simple prescription, but with simplicity comes ignoring of the inevitable complexity of life, and when faced with complexity they just lash out as they simply don't know how to deal with it. Yes, they believe they are doing the world a favour by trying to eliminate non-muslims because with homogeneity comes peace. If everyone was Muslim - and the same type of muslim - there would be peace. Again, oversimplification, because human beings are complex and if they're not fighting about religion they are fighting about something else. If everyone is the same there will be peace - therefore we must have harsh penalties for people who go out of line to scare them into submission and conformity - i.e. "peace." And isn't it presumptuous to decree that ISLAM of all religion should be the dominant one? How do you know other religions aren't also true or at least worthy of respect? And that's why I struggle with religion altogether - how could they all be true? 

I don't share these views publicly with ANYONE (except my SO, who agrees with me completely) for fear of my safety and people thinking I'm a bigot. I just can't see any good in MODERN Islam. 

I don't want a lecture on how Islam was so great and at the forefront of intellectual innovation 800 years ago. Islam then was a very different culture and a much more liberal interpretation of the religion. I'm referring to Modern Islam and ONLY Modern Islam. As in, Islamic Society Right Now. 

Islam and its growth threatens the good societal progress we're experiencing and is a purely negative force. 

EDIT1: I know that a lot of people are excusing Islamic behaviour with colonialism. Yet most Muslim countries in the Middle East were never colonized. In fact, the more islamofascist countries tend to have never been colonized (eg Saudi, UAE, Afghanistan, Syria), and the colonized Muslim countries relatively "chill"  - Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. 

And by "chill" I mean chill to Islamist country standards, not global standards. Even the mildest Muslim countries have their sharia nonsense. </selfText></submission>

CMV.</title><commentCount>101</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1zxn5g/i_believe_those_who_are_prolife_but_support/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Pro-life rhetoric is mostly based on the idea that a fetus is a human being and should therefore be untouchable by anyone, including the woman carrying it. If pro-lifers really are in it for humanity, wouldn't the logical conclusion be for them to be against all killing? Why should it matter what a person has done with their life? Are they still not human? Can someone stop having thoughts or a soul after committing a heinous crime? No, obviously not. So why is it that fetuses are seen as sacred little balls of "life" but once its out of the womb and has been around for a while it's ok to kill it in (up until recent years) the most horrific ways possible? 

*Update*; I changed my mind, you guys. I guess in the "protecting the innocent" line of thinking, opposing abortion and supporting death penalties would make logical sense. 

*Edit*; /u/DevilishRogue expressed interest in whether or not my views on the death penalty and abortion have been changed by this thread. The answer is no, not really. My views on those who are against abortion but support the death penalty have changed. I still believe safe abortions are just one aspect of ensuring women are equal, successful members of society who have every opportunity available to them, and that bodily autonomy is the most basic human right. I also am still on the fence when it comes to capital punishment. On one hand, you have dozens of people who very well deserve to die for their horrific crimes, but on the other hand you have dozens of people who are wrongly convicted. Do we take this imperfect system as it is? Is possibly killing hundreds of innocents an acceptable means to kill those hundreds who deserve it? I'm not sure. For those of you who wish to discuss these topics more, I could make a separate thread upon request. Thank you guys for all your responses.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>38</id><identifier>2dygof</identifier><title>CMV:Death row inmates should either not be allowed to make any appeals at all or a minimum of one</title><commentCount>101</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2dygof/cmvdeath_row_inmates_should_either_not_be_allowed/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Let me start by saying I am NOT here to debate on whether or not the death penalty is justified. I'm here to debate my view concerning appeals and what happens after someone lands on death row. Let us also assume that our hypothetical death row inmate is proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt and is most definitely guilty of the crimes that have landed him on death row in the first place.

A common argument against the death penalty is that it costs many times more than just letting a convict rot in prison for the rest of his life. This is true only because of appeals made by the death row inmate which can run into millions of dollars of taxpayers' money wasted and years wasted just so he can get executed anyway.

The only reason why the death penalty costs so much is because of all the stupid and useless appeals filed by pro-bono law groups in the names of death row inmates for no other reason than to make the process more expensive so that later on they can complain about how expensive the process is. They create the problem within a system they disagree with so they can complain about the problem with the system. You shouldn't create a large flaw and then use it as evidence that you are correct.

A counter argument to my view could be that the death row inmate still deserves a right to appeal regardless of his actions or the fact that he is on death row. My argument against that is as follows:

 We have decided as a nation and a society that some crimes are so heinous that they deserve the worst punishment, meaning taking someone's life away or their taking their right to live away. Many would agree that a person's life is the most valuable thing you can ever possess and is the only thing that truly belongs to you. Now if we have a justice system that deems it justifiable and acceptable to take someone's life away if they have been proven of committing certain horrible crimes like murder in a court of law, then I really don't think taking away a death row inmate's right to appeal is that big of a deal and something to get angry over.

If new evidence is found that casts doubt on a person's guilt, then I can see why an appeal would be necessary. The key word is IF. In our hypothetical situation the person being disallowed of making an appeal or multiple appeals is 100% guilty. An example would be they were found holding the murder weapon standing over the victim covered in their blood laughing maniacly. So no evidence in the world can save them from execution.

That leaves one alternative to our usual costly method of multiple million dollar appeals that take years and years to process. A bullet costs less than $2. A rope costs less than $15 dollars and is reusable. Hell you could recruit people off the street that own their own gun and bullets who would be WILLING to execute a death row murderer or mass murderer. 

The inmate is dead and justice is served at little to zero to the taxpayers in a timely and efficient manner. I can't really think of any good counter arguments to my view but that is where you guys come in. Change my view!

Edit: Since people are saying my hypothetical situation defeats the purpose of appeals I'm going to narrow it down to the real world. My argument now is that not every single person on death row should be allowed appeals or multiple appeals if the case for their guilt is too grear for their claimed innocence to be **Reasonably** faced. Someone like a serial killer or a mass shooter who guns a bunch of people down in public in clear view of everyone and the police. Letting someone like that appeal over and over again to the point their scheduled execution is a decade or more away, all the while mocking the justice system and wasting millions of dollars and vast amounts of resources, is wrong and completely ridiculous. Our current system is greatly flawed due to the fact that any prisoner regardless of the case against them can and will abuse and exploit the appeals system to delay their impending death with the help of lawyers and pro bono law groups who then use the large cost as proof that we shouldn't have the death penalty, even though they are making the problem even worse than it should be while claiming the moral high ground. 

Here is a link describing how horrible and inefficient it is currently: http://m.sfgate.com/opinion/saunders/article/The-triumph-of-dubious-death-penalty-appeals-5631469.php

California has sentenced 900 people to the death penalty since 1972 and executed 13. The average stay for a death row inmate in California is over 15 years long due to them filing appeal after appeal. Most of them die of old age rather than getting executed. This is greatly inefficient and ridiculous and anyone should be able to see that 13 out of 900 sentenced is sad. That is little over 1 percent of the total prisoners sentenced to the death penalty since 1972. Anyone who looks at this as anything near acceptable and proper justice is being ridiculous and most of all mistaken. 

 The cost of the death penalty in California has totaled over $4 billion since 1978. I wonder how much of it was spent unnecessarily on appeals that only resulted in extending the criminal's life and nothing more

Link describing the appeals process: 
http://criminal.lawyers.com/criminal-law-basics/death-sentence-appeals-take-time-for-a-reason.html

In 2010, a death row inmate waited an average of 178 months (or close to 15 years) between sentencing and execution. Nearly a quarter of deaths on death row in the U.S. are due to natural causes. More evidence our current appeals system is a joke and should be improved upon.

* Innocent people have been convicted and executed. 

* The death penalty is incompatible with human rights and human dignity (Even the guilty have a right to life)

* Killing is wrong

* There is a better way to help the families of murder victims (executions do not help these people heal nor do they end their pain)

* Capital punishment goes against almost every religion.

<submission><id>40</id><identifier>1kjas7</identifier><title>Living in almost any European country is vastly superior to living in America. CMV</title><commentCount>101</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1kjas7/living_in_almost_any_european_country_is_vastly/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I'll get right into it. With few (any?) exceptions, Europe is WAY better to live in than America. I'll list nearly every reason I can think of. The list may seem a bit nitpicky, but I feel every reason contributes in some way to the quality of life in both areas.

The first criticism I expect to get is that I am simply picking and choosing ways Europe is superior while ignoring ways in which America has the upper-hand. For this reason, a second list will be included, listing ways I think America is better than Europe.

Let's begin:

1. More vacation time and shorter working hours. Europeans get far more vacation time and shorter work weeks. Yet they are still more productive per capita than America is. In addition, they get mandated maternity and sick leave.

2. Europeans have universal healthcare. Yes, this is paid by taxes, but it is far more affordable for everyone and no one is disqualified because of a medical condition. In addition, over half of all bankruptcies in America are because of medical debt. And having insurance doesn't help anything at all. In America, you can go bankrupt at any time through no fault of your own.

3. Americans no longer have pensions and will not be able to retire in the future. Most European jobs have guaranteed pensions.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/americans-not-saving-for-retirement

4. Americans do not have universal education, meaning Americans are drowning in debt before they even get into the workforce. This is virtually unheard of in Europe.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt
http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/student-debt-and-the-crushing-of-the-american-dream/?_r=0

Those are actually the main reasons right there. Those 4 reasons alone should make you want to move to Europe. I have one life to live. Spending it $200k in student debt working 80 hours a week with 0 vacation time and no retirement with the looming fear that you can go bankrupt and lose it all at any time is an absolutely horrible way to live life. I would honestly rather kill myself than live like this. But there's a better solution: move to a civilized country. Here are more reasons:

5. Europeans have less intrusive advertisements and have less blatant corporate advertising than America. Huge billboards are considered distracting to drivers in Europe and there are fewer commercials on TV.

6. The food is better in Europe. Europeans have stricter methods than the FDA of their food supply. They have a more balanced diet and eat less fast food than Americans.

7. Almost every nation besides America uses the metric system, which is far more efficient and simpler, with less mistakes resulting from inaccurate measurements. In addition, they use the "Day Month Year" method on their calendars and use a 24 hour clock.

8. Europeans use manual transmission on their cars, which up until recently was more fuel efficient than automatic cars.

9. Americans incarcerate more people and serve longer jail sentences than any other developed country. Most of those serving are in for drug related offenses, something uncommon in Europe. Europeans understand that prison is for rehabilitation, not punishment. In addition, America still uses the death penalty.

10. America has the largest military budget in the world and uses it to wage war against foreign nations for little rational reason. If we spent even a third of that budget for education and healthcare, we could join the rest of the developed world in having universal healthcare and education.

11. Americans have far more gun crime and gun related deaths.

12. Many Americans (certainly not all or even most though) hate criticisms of their country and treat it as "God's country." This blind patriotism is unheard of in Europe.

13. Infant circumcision is common in America, but considered immoral by most Europeans unless it's voluntary.

14. Europeans include taxes on their prices automatically, but in America you have to manually add it, which is inconvenient and misleads the consumer into thinking something is cheaper than it really is.

15. Americans are more obese and unhealthy than most Europeans.

Some more controversial ones:

16. Nudity is considered taboo in America, but is common in Europe. I see no reason why a naked body should be considered immoral or taboo, but I do not want a debate about this.

17. Americans are far more religious. Again, very controversial, but I consider this a bad thing.

18. Europeans are more open about drugs, abortion, gay marriage, etc. Again, I'm not trying to have a debate about these topics specifically. These could obviously go either way for many people, so please do not attack my argument on these points alone.

And now for the American list:

1. Americans pay lower taxes resulting in higher take-home pay. Although it could also be argued the other way. Europeans pay higher taxes because they have a wider, more encompassing safety net. It results in less personal take-home pay, but higher financial security.

2. Americans tend to pay less than most for housing, cars, alcohol, etc.

3. Assuming you are successful in America, you could have a better life than almost anyone, European or otherwise. America has tremendous wealth inequality (which should be included in my reasons above) which for 99% of people is horrible. But if you claw your way to the upper echelons of the successful 1%, you could live a life of luxury beyond almost anything Europe has to offer.

That's pretty much all I've got. Sad, isn't it?

Also, before anyone points it out, I realize my sources aren't exactly scholarly. I chose sources mainly for ease of reading. However, most of them cite credible studies and the same information could easily be found in a more scholarly format with some more research. I'm here to argue why America doesn't have paid vacations and healthcare for all citizens, not whether or not the Huffington Post is reliable or not. So, with that in mind, CMV.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>41</id><identifier>3gwou8</identifier><title>CMV: Sexual predators who prey upon minors should either be executed or kept in prison for life. No attempt at rehabilitating them for release back into society should be made.</title><commentCount>98</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3gwou8/cmv_sexual_predators_who_prey_upon_minors_should/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>This is a somewhat complex issue but I'll try to explain it and my views on what I think should be done.

Some people have an innate attraction towards children. This is sad. They can't act on it without harming someone. Some act on it and rape/molest children. This is also sad and horrible.

So we catch a child predator and put him in prison. As far as I know there is no law allowing for child predators to be put away for life. I know in some states the death penalty can be applied but isn't always carried out.

The child predator gets convicted and goes to prison for however long the sentence is.

There are those who say that people who prey upon children should be rehabilitated and released back into society. I am unaware of any programs that try to rehabilitate pedophiles and child predators. If they do exist and if they have succeeded at rehabilitating people, please tell me since I don't know much concerning that aspect of this debate.

So the child predator enters a program to make sure he doesn't re offend when he enters society. If he shows potential and meets the criteria for being released (Whatever the criteria may be) he gets released in the hopes he can become a productive citizen that doesn't harm children.

This is a good thing on its face, at least to some people. I DO believe that if we are to release people like those who have sex with or molest children, we should at least make the attempt to prevent them from doing it again.

I don't know how successful these programs have been at making sure child predators don't re offend. I don't know the percentage of success vs failure, as in what number of those in the program went on to molest or rape again compared to those that didn't.

However, I believe the margin of error is too great to take the chance to release these people back into society as opposed to keeping them in prison for life or executing them.

By margin of error I don't necessarily know that the percentage of those who will re offend is too high to be statistically feasible, I don't know what the exact statistics are concerning this. I would like to know however.

Let's say that for every child predator that becomes viable for release and is entered into a program designed to rehabilitate them so they don't rape or molest more kids as soon as they leave prison, that out of every 100, 1 or 5 or 10 will re offend and rape or molest AT LEAST 1 child.

I believe that even if the success rate is many times higher than the rate of failure, it is still too high to be  morally feasible or even ethical.

No system is perfect. Chances are that out of all the sex offenders who are "rehabilitated", at least some of them WILL go on to rape or molest more children. Knowing this, we shouldn't release them at all. We should either execute them or keep them in prison until they die of old age.

I value the well being of the victims and the potential victims more than I do that of the perpetrators. Even if a program was created so that 99% of all who enter it never harm a single child again, that 1% is far too high to be allowed to occur.

It isn't high statistically of course. But the human cost is too high. Money can be replaced. Property can be replaced or fixed. If you get beaten up your wounds will heal eventually. You can't heal from getting raped or molested as a child. From that point on your life is changed. You have to deal with those memories for the rest of your life. Your whole life will be a battle to overcome what happened to you. Mentally and emotionally an event as traumatizing as that can be damaging. You can become depressed or addicted to drugs. Living life as a rape victim is not pleasant at all. It's a nightmare. Especially at such a young age to be raped or molested.

If you support this idea, are you going to be able to look into the face of the friends and family of the innocent child/children that was raped or molested by someone who was supposed to be cured or fixed of his/her desire to fuck kids and tell them:

"I'm sorry your loved one was harmed and is now going to be traumatized for life and will have this horrific event in their mind indefinitely. I'm sorry but we had to release these people back into society and make sure they don't harm anymore children. Your case, though tragic, was simply a statistical error that we couldn't account for. Meanwhile we will continue to release people just like the person who raped your child in the hopes they don't re offend"

That's a really cold and fucked up thing to tell someone whose son or daughter was raped or molested. Telling the victim that their tragedy was the result of a 1% chance of failure or a 5% chance in a program designed to prevent children being harmed is just inconsiderate.

It seems like it values the perpetrators and ignores the victims. I value the life and well being of innocent children more than that of those could harm them.

It isn't moral to release 100 people with the knowledge that a small fraction of them will certainly cause more pain and suffering. 

I'm not saying that pedophiles and the like can't be rehabilitated. I'm saying that it isn't a 100% guarantee of success so we shouldn't release any of them, regardless of their chances. The margin of error (A child or children being raped or molested) is too high to be feasible or ethical/moral.

So I suggest either we create a program that can 100% guarantee that those in said program won't rape or molest again when they get freedom (Not likely at all with modern technology) or we keep them in prison for life. Or execute them. I'm fine with any of those options.

Any measure that prevents children from harm is necessary and ethical. Even if it means keeping convicted sex offenders in prison for the rest of their natural lives.

My view can be changed by proving that the pros of releasing child predators back into society after attempting to rehabilitate them is larger than the cons of children being molested or raped by someone who was "cured" or "rehabilitated."

You have to prove that it is worth it morally/ethically to rehabilitate sex offenders and release them back into society even if the chance that they will re offend again is not certain or consists of a small percentage (Lower than 10%)

Edit: Arguments should address whether or not the rehabilitation and release of sex offenders who prey upon children is feasible or ethical. Try to avoid slippery slope arguments because I'm **NOT** proposing that any other crime besides rape or molestation be punished with life in prison. I'm not saying we should put litterers and people who steal candy bars away for life. Don't attack arguments I haven't made by using the slippery slope fallacy.</selfText></submission>

This argument pertains to America.

Humans are flawed, they make mistakes.  Our judicial system relies on the use of humans, therefore, mistakes will occur in the judicial system, meaning mistakes will occur in the judgement of accused people.  Therefore, innocent people will, and have been, sent to death.  If you were sentenced to life in prison as an innocent, you would have a lifetime for more evidence to come out and a chance for the truth the come forward, and for you to be released, which has happened before.  Sure it sucks, but if you ask those people that this has happened to: "would you rather be free now, having gone through that, or wished to just have been given the death penalty from day one?" I'm sure you would find a recurring answer.  

If you agree with the death penalty then you need to be totally okay with the thought of being sentenced to death for a crime you didn't commit and be able to say to yourself "well this sucks, but I understand that people make mistakes so I will accept this outcome," and you are not allowed to say "man I wish I would be sentenced to life in prison so I can get my message out there, and wait for more evidence, I need more time."

.

Secondly, even if I cannot get you to disagree with this penalty logically, I would argue that as an advancement of society, we shouldn't feed our animalistic desire for revenge, and instead take an economic approach to the issue and see that it [costs less](http://www.nbcrightnow.com/story/15519792/what-costs-more-the-death-penalty-or-life-in-prison) to the tax payer to keep a man in prison for life than to put him on death row and kill him.

Also, only for absolutely heinous crimes like murder.

I believe that everyone of us that lives in a society has tacitly agreed to a social contract and to abide by the society's laws. By committing a crime like murder, this contract is broken and the individual has given up the right to live in that particular society. As such, the death penalty seems like the only way to remove the murderer from society and prevent him from threatening the safety of others. Exile seems like an option too, but it is quite clearly no longer a realistic option in today's globalised and interconnected world. 

I have read certain arguments saying that the state does not have the right to take another person's life. However, I believe that the state does in fact have this right, since the person has broken the social contract and the state has the duty to protect the safety of others in society. Also, since we have already conceded that the state has the right to restrict the freedom of individuals by putting them in prisons when they commit a crime, I don't see how it is much more of a stretch to say that they similarly have the right to take another person's life when they commit a much more heinous crime.

Also, while I generally support rehabilitation, I think that it is only appropriate for lesser crimes like drug abuse or assault. A murderer will cause a much bigger threat to society (even after having undergone rehabilitation, there is no guarantee that the individual will not murder again) and I do not think that others that live in the society deserve to be put under this threat.

Hence, these are the main reasons why I am in favour of the death penalty. Of course, I am assuming that the accused is mentally sound to make the choice of committing the crime.

There has been a lot of controversy in the recent years surrounding failed attempts in which the person to be executed suffers for hours in tremendous pain. Either due to the drugs being incorrect, the IV being incorrectly played; or any number of other reasons.

It seems to me that this is an extremely inhumane method of killing someone. 

And it goes deeper than the possibility of failure. For my own personal opinion of it, lethal injection would be utter **horror**. I have a serious phobia of needles and drugs. I'd rather die burning alive than receiving a lethal injection. The thought of it, being strapped to a table with an IV jammed into my vein and lethal drugs pumped into my system.. I feel light headed just typing this. 

So the question is, why don't we use a method that is 100% fatal and completely humane, namely a high-powered gun attached to a mechanical trigger (so no one has to hold it manually to fire it) aimed at the back of the neck to sever the spinal cord instantly. 

This would be instantaneous and without any pain for the death row inmate, and far easier to prepare and enact for the prison.

As a current example, what is your stance on abortion? The death penalty? Illegal immigration?  Chances are you are either for or against, but I would imagine the more intellectually minded of would respond with "What are the circumstances?"
In the case of abortion, would your stance change if the pregnancy could kill the mother?  Would you change your stance on death penalty if it was that of a man who broke into your home and raped your wife or child?  Does your view of 'illegal immigration' change when you realize they just want a 'better life?'  
Apply these questions to yourself, analyze them, think on them.  In the presence of intense scrutiny by logic and reason, good and evil become non-factors.  Using arguments from morality turn what should be an objective debate into blind subjectivity, and bring progress to a halt.  This is why I believe that reason and logic are the true means to justice and morality is but a mere façade.

CMV</title><commentCount>97</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1ryer5/capital_punishment_needs_to_be_abolished_cmv/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>My name is Jared and I am a 10th grader who wrote a research report about capital punishment. In my research, I found that by abolishing the death penalty, states would be able to save money, the innocent wouldn't be killed and our values of what truly is justice would be better served. [This is a serious topic, hateful, ignorant and inappropriate comments will be removed] Here are some of the main points I conveyed in my paper.
I am not asking for people to help my paper. I am asking for your opinions. 


1.People who have been convicted of crimes have to go through endless court appeals, analysis of evidence, and re-trials. This clogs our judicial system with unnecessary paperwork and expenses.

2.Endless appeals combined with the re-trialing of cases cost state and local taxpayers "1 billion dollars in funds" (Deathpenaltyinfo.org)

3) Acts such as mass murders are carried in emotions of anger and retaliation. By funding the death penalty, we create a perpetual cycle of such attitudes which exemplifies that we should murder people to show that murdering is villainous

4) State governments can channel their money towards more beneficial causes such as preventing crime from happening in the first place.


1) As a nation, we have prided ourselves for practicing the values of justice and liberty. However, how can we call are government fair if we still use barbaric measures to justify adequate punishment for criminals?

2) Murder by a citizen would have severe consequences. However, a government-sanctioned murder is not only socially acceptable but “enforceable”

3) However numerous studies have justified that the death as a punishment is no “bigger of a deterrent than throwing someone in jail

4) We send an appalling message to the American people and other countries of the world that we are a nation that uses archaic ways to punish criminals.


2) If we are to advance as a society we must move away from the “eye for an eye mentality". Life without parole is a better alternative than the death penalty because there are no issues regarding morality and doesn't spread hatred

3) People have the ability to change, one such example is Shaka Senghor, who at the age of 19 shot and killed a man. During his incarceration in prison, Shaka Senghor developed a passion for writing and wrote six compelling novels depicting his life growing up on the ghetto streets of Detroit.

4) Shaka lives by the mantra that the actions of his past do not define the person who he is today. In part of his work, Shaka has received numerous accolades from various colleges including the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. He hopes that the victim’s family will forgive him for the actions he had caused when he was younger

Conclusion The lessons of Shaka Senghor, give us greater understanding that the value justice is not the death of criminal but realization of one’s past actions. 

Please remember to be nice when commenting. I am only doing this to see your opinion not cause hatred.

As concepts, ten years of incarceration is ten years of punishment, and two years of community service is two years of (minor) punishment. However death is an infinite punishment (from a secular view point) thus mathematically requiring an infinitely heinous crime of which you are infinitely sure that the accused has committed. Of course this is impossible and therefore the death penalty can never be warranted.

Change my view.

<submission><id>48</id><identifier>1yng8d</identifier><title>Police should be subject to additional criminal charges for "Violation of the Public Trust" when they are found to have acted outside of their appropriate legal authority. [CMV]</title><commentCount>93</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1yng8d/police_should_be_subject_to_additional_criminal/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I think we might need to institute a new criminal law called **"Violation of the Public Trust"** where a representative of the legal system can be charged with the additional crime of violating the trust and responsibility the public and the law itself expects from such officials by acting beyond the bounds of their legitimate authority. This would allow specific criminal charges in addition to the already available civil penalties a citizen might seek in compensation for false arrest, assault or death resulting from inappropriate police behavior. A conviction might allow or obligate a judge to increase the prison sentence or add community service for an offender. 

This criminal charge would bring such cases before an actual jury of citizens and allow them to review the evidence for themselves rather than having a single judge make a unilateral decision or a biased "internal review board" clear the cop behind closed doors. We need these cases heard in open court and subject to public scrutiny via the media. The current secrecy and "brotherhood" slap-on-the-wrist penalties do nothing to protect the public or achieve justice for the victims of police lies and brutality.

Currently, police are allowed more lee-way to use force under the assumption that they are acting in the public good. Even when this act is later shown to be improper, it is assumed they were acting in "good faith" and thus not subject to penalty.  Either citizens must equally be assumed to have acted in "good faith" in use of force against police and not subject to prosecution, or cops must be equally subject to criminal penaly when they overstep, regardless of whether they *believed* they were doing the right thing.

*****

Edit: although my view has not technically changed, some clarification is in order. I have asserted that there *should* be a law that specifically punishes "abuse of authority" and several respondents have said this already exists. I have called this "Violation of the Public Trust", but the existing law is [Section 242 of Title 18 - DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/242fin.php). This law should, and does, exist, but it may not go far enough nor include the full range of what the average person might consider an "abuse" of police power. Additionally, it appears that this law is under-used by timid prosecutors afraid of losing their political appointment and angering the police who can then make their job as a prosecutor difficult. Some other mode seems necessary to ensure accusations of abuse are handled fairly and openly.

One other point raised is that regular citizens can be arrested and charged on the word of an officer alone. An officers sworn affidavit of eyewitness is given more weight and is often sufficient to "prove" guilt (e.g. speeding being the most common, but also "resisting" arrest). This power is not available to average citizens when making accusations of police abuse. When a citizen makes an accusation it is treated as a mere "complaint" and then handled by "internal review" which most often finds no wrongdoing, even in cases where evidence was available that later clearly showed the complaint was true. 

My version of this law would force such complaints to be treated like any other criminal accusation and tried in open court like any other crime. This would take the power to determine guilt or innocence out from behind the closed doors of the precinct and put it in front of the public for a jury of citizens to judge for themselves. Perhaps a necessary feature would be to make prosecuting these cases compulsory so that DAs don't get the blame for bringing charges and avoid placing that strain on their relationship with the police. Having this separate charge would also allow juries to find the officer specifically guilty of only abusing their power, even if evidence was lacking to prove other criminal acts.

*****

Edit2: some have mentioned the existence of "Citizen Review Boards" as an argument against my idea. Here is one such example. Others also exist. 

[NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Complaint_Review_Board)

*"All cases sent to the Police Commissioner come with recommendation of discipline made by the Board, which the Commissioner has the privilege to review and enforce or overrule. In fact, if s/he so chooses, the Commissioner can essentially dismiss the complaint once he receives it."*

In other words, such bodies have no teeth. One additional option that should be available is to give these review boards the authority to pursue criminal charges, at least so far as to mandate a [Grand Jury](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury) be convened to look at the evidence and determine if an indictment is warranted.

*****

Edit3: some have also argued that, since police work is difficult, cops should receive significant protection in the course of acting as enforcers. My response:

*"Lest this post give the wrong impression, I will openly state here that I have tremendous respect for the very valuable job that Good Cops do, and I am very certian that the majority of cops* **are** *good and* **are** *acting appropriately, according to strict policy/procedure, and with only the best of intentions. I agree that better training is always good and I would encourage all departments to riase the minimum education requirement for an officer to a Masters in Criminal Justice or equivalent law degree.*

*"Our police should be the epitome of civility, intellect and physical prowess, not simply brutish thugs with a badge and a gun who excell only at following orders. I realize this is a VERY high standard, but I believe it is fully appropriate. If we are to give individuals such authority, we must demand that they be raised to this level of power and responsibility because they have proved they are worthy. Then we must expect them to demonstrate that worthiness on a daily basis in every official act.*

*"If you are one of these Good Cops, you should have nothing to fear from such a law as I propose, just as innocent citizens who have done no wrong should have nothing to fear from police who are acting within the bounds of their appropriate authority. It is improper to say that a cop's decisions should not be subject to a more strict review or the possibility of criminal prosecution simply because the job is difficult ("You don't know what it's like out there or what we have to deal with! you don't get to judge me!").*

*"Would you so broadly excuse the mistakes of a surgeon if their mistake resulted in your father's death simply because surgery is complicated? Would you accept the excuse, "You don't know what it's like! Don't judge me! You're not a surgeon!" if such was their defense for improper or criminal behavior? Many jobs are difficult and many tough decisions must be made. The difficulty of the job is no excuse for significant, or especially lethal, errors in judgement, let alone willful abuse of power."*

*****

Edit4: It seems to me that taking these decisions out of the hands of secret "internal review boards" and putting them on full display in court to be witnessed by the public and decided by a jury should have the intended effect of achieving justice for the victim and actual punishment for the offender as well as serving as a deterent to other officers who might take similar criminal action in violation of the public trust. I can't imagine this being a bad thing in any way. Why should we have one standard for citizens accused of a crime and another for police accused of a crime while on-duty? Are they to be treated as some "ruling class" above the law and favored with special treatment?

 I am accused of a crime and I am arrested, placed in jail, forced to pay bond if I wish to be free, taken to court and subject to prosecution by the full power of the state in collusion with the very arresting officer who made the claim that he witnessed me breaking the law in the first place.

An officer is accused of a crime and he gets put on paid leave while a closed-door, sealed-record "review" is conducted by fellow officers who typically dismiss the case or more rarely provide some impotent reprimand, after which the officer is back on the street free to continue such abuse at will.

How can such a thing even remotely be considered proper? How can this not be viewed as some "illuminati"-style double standard where those who enforce the law are themselves virtually immune to the law? Why would we not try these cases in open court rather than having some toothless parallel process that allows police to evade real justice?

*****

Edit5: question and answer from responses below...

&gt; "What governs the use of deadly force against unarmed civilians..."

&gt; *Everybody defines it differently, but more or less the standard is: If the police officer reasonably believes that the person represents a grave threat to them or others ("grave" meaning serious enough to possibly be fatal or near-fatal), they can use deadly force.*

My response...

"It would seem appropriate then that so long as a citizen reasonably felt they or others were at grave theat from an officer then that citizen should have the authority to use deadly force against that officer. And, as we must presume innocence, we should simply take the citizen's word for it and let the matter be. After all, the cop brought a weapon to a public place and this indicates a willingness if not outright intent to use it. We can simply convene a closed door council of the citizen's neighbors to hear his account and they can conclude he acted appropriately. Or, if he did not, he can be let go with a warning not to kill any more cops under similar circumstances. No more criminal charges for killing police. Actually, I rather like this plan.  Perhaps I will CMV after all."

I am largely really anti-conservative, I'm a huge advocate for gay rights, equal pay, etc.

However, ever since I was a little kid, I have *always* thought the death penalty is an acceptable form of punishment for a person who has committed a heinous crime and has been proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. 

I'm a pretty firm believer in an eye for an eye, which I know isn't the way to solve things, but I feel is just. If someone rapes and kills children, IMO, they deserve to die. If they kill many people, I don't care how mentally ill they are, they deserve to die. And I know that people usually say they'd rather a person rot in prison than die and get off easy, but death row inmates spend *years* in prison before they are killed.

I found this website that was the final statement of every death row inmate before they were executed, and I found it only strengthened my view. I can't see a more fitting punishment than death for a crime worthy of the death penalty.

Now, to be clear, I only see the death penalty as appropriate for *really* terrible crimes. As I said already, rape and/or murder of kids, serial killings, *proven* acts of terrorism (through fair trial, I despise Guantanamo) that resulted in multiple deaths, and really violent or twisted premeditated murders. I don't think a guy who snapped and shot his wife deserves to die, I think he deserves life in prison. I think a guy who murdered his entire family in cold blood deserves to die.

Anyway, I feel like this can't be a good way to think. I'm liberal on pretty much every other issue and would like to become so on this one too. That said, I'm pretty firmly set in my ways. So, reddit, CMV.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>50</id><identifier>4velfm</identifier><title>CMV: Regardless of its costs, the death penalty philosophically should not be used</title><commentCount>97</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4velfm/cmv_regardless_of_its_costs_the_death_penalty/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Firstly, I won't be able to respond for a bit, mods please don't remove this post!

What I am talking about here is, assuming that it has no cost to society (which the death penalty has as it is more expensive due to appeals, and it gets the wrong person sometimes), the death penalty should not be used.  If it is significantly BENEFICIAL to society, it should be used, I'm talking about its use in a vacuum.

So, I think regardless of evidence, and regardless of the person (i. e. even Hitler), I don't think that the death penalty should be used.

This is for a few reasons.  Firstly, I think everyone can change, and the death penalty robs them of their chance to do so.  Take the example of Hitler - he was a meth addict, and was probably pretty crazy, but with modern technology/mental health services, I bet there is a chance he could be changed.  Secondly, the death penalty has shown to have little to no incentive.  In fact, in the case of terrorism, it may be counterproductive as Islamic terrorists look forward to martyrdom.  Thirdly, I think that people are (mostly) products of their surroundings.  While I do believe in some amount of free will, I am a law abiding citizen, but I don't think that I can say with confidence that if I was a poor man involved in a robbery, for example, I wouldn't shoot a store clerk while robbing them if they went for their gun.  

Fourthly, and I think most importantly, the existence of the death penalty promotes a government sponsored narrative that killing someone in cold blood for the sole purpose of vengeance is moral.  If someone did that in real life, even if the person was clearly guilty, we would look down on that person... but it's okay when the government does it?  Hell, maybe the fact that the government does do it encourages people to do things out of vengeance rather than justice.

I realize this is a pretty extreme view, so cmv.

I am not referring to political liberals per se. I'm referring to anyone with **primarily** left leaning standards in many key issues. Take the social breakdown of your choice. Nuclear holocaust. Total destruction of computer network infrastructure, Race war. Zombie apocalypse. Alien invasion. Mass riots, Global genocide, superstorms, melted ice caps, famine, pestilence, plague, Revelations, Anything short of an ELE. If society broke down and we as a people were not mollycoddled in the safety of our computers, tablets, and cellphones, then there are certain groups of people who will either give up their ideals or they simply won't be able to make it post apocalypse.

1: **Gun control advocates:** You refuse to own a gun? To shoot another person? You won't be lasting long. Other survivors will have guns. Not everyone who survives will be nice. They will kill you for what you have. And what you have may be the only things keeping you alive. You will have a gun and you will kill or you will be dead.

2: ~~**Anti hunters~~/Vegans/Vegetarians:** You think you're going to live long enough for your victory garden to grow you a food supply? Not likely mate. Hunting and eating meat will be one of the biggest necessities for survival in the entire apocalypse. Partial CMV'd by /u/Sierra_Echo_Foxtrot

~~3: **Socialists/Wealth redistributers:** You think just because money is gone that Capitalism will be dead? That everybody will happily share whatever they have? Not hardly. Barter and trade (as well as outright piracy) among survivor groups will be the standard.~~ **CMV'd by /u/MontiBurns

~~4: **Pacifists:** Need I really elaborate? If you won't fight or kill, you will be dead in no time.~~ Unbelievably CMV'd by /u/jetpacksforall

5: **Cop/Soldier haters:**: Your internet snarkiness and protest signs won't be of much use to you now. However, a well trained cop or soldier will be quite the asset to have on your side.

~~6: **Feminists:** Well, I have a feeling that you'll finally actually have that rape culture you're always going on about. Not that I think you'll get much joy out of finally being right. Overall, I think you're gonna have a bad time.~~ CMV'd by /u/Siiimo

~~7: **Race baiters:** Nobody will be in the mood to be hearing the Al Sharptons or the Grand Wizard Cyclopses in the surviving world. People trying to instigate that kind of internal discord when everyone is just trying to scavenge their next meal will mysteriously not be coming back to the base camp after a hunting excursion.~~ CMV'd by /u/Siiimo

8: **Intellectual snobs/Logic mongers:** If you were to question your group leader's decisions and use phrases like "strawman" or "fallacy of the middle" then you are probably going to be shot in the face. Smarts and intelligence will be needed to survive, but intellectual arrogance will be a liability. 

9: **Anti-Death Penalty Advocates:**What are you going to do with that loose cannon in your group? The rapist? The food thief? The captured enemy? Your moral high ground won't save you here.

~~10: **Environmentalists:** I doubt you'll be hugging many trees post apocalypse. You'll be cutting them down with the rest of us for fire and shelter. You'll be eating whatever endangered species crosses your path. You'll either happily kill the last known Fuzzy Feathered Pipsquack Bird and stuff your coat with it's feathers or you'll freeze to death in the nuclear winter.~~ CMV'd by /u/ZanzaraEE  /u/Raintee97 

Now I know that CMV users like to nitpick over word usage and minute details. I've done it myself. So lets avoid that particular line of attack. I don't operate in pure black and white. I understand shades of grey. **I know that not ALL liberals would be useless.** I know that not 100% ALL of any of the types of people listed wouldn't survive in some way. That's why I used "primarily" in the title. I also know that some of these types will survive if they were to give up or go against their ideals. (Pick up a gun, etc.) The overall point of the CMV is that those who cling to those leftist ideals won't *generally* survive long term. So I will not argue with you over semantics or word usage. (liberal, leftist, useless, etc) I think you're smart enough to argue the spirit of the CMV without resorting to that cliche.

I want someone to show me exactly how [somebody](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/067/COLLEGE-LIBERAL.jpg) who insists on clinging to these ideals would survive and be useful to the other survivors.

P.S. I wish I could include atheists and bible thumpers in this list but there are plenty of both who use guns and are/were trained soldiers, so I think they would have a better than average chance, so long as they kept their annoying opinions to themselves.

Not experiments that involve high amount of pain of course, the kind of experiments that are pain-free (or almost pain-free) but with a high chance of death.

EDIT: I have not been very clear, I am talking about only one experiment per person, and the inmate dying anyway, whether the experiment has succes or it doesn't, within the experiment itself. Once put to sleep, he knows he is not going to wake up.

EDIT2: [My view has been changed](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3173dl/cmv_people_sentenced_to_death_should_be_used_in/cpz2t1a), something like this will likely increase the number of death penalties.

<submission><id>53</id><identifier>2p13uo</identifier><title>CMV: If you knowingly wrongly accuse someone of a crime, you should be exposed to the same minimum and maximum sentence the accused would have been exposed to.</title><commentCount>81</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2p13uo/cmv_if_you_knowingly_wrongly_accuse_someone_of_a/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Everyone, whether they are being truthful or not, knows the consequences of accusing someone else of a crime. You know that they will probably be charged, and you know the order of magnitude of punishment they will receive.

Take a scenario where you knowingly wrongfully accuse someone of murder, and they get the death penalty as a result. I would say that you *murdered* this person and therefore should be exposed to the death penalty yourself in trial. 

This seems to especially apply in cases of rape. While there are no doubt actual rapes that do occur. False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South, where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.

This tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and (this is what I believe, and not the subject of this post) Bill Cosby. 

A person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear, but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others.

I have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here.

**Rightful accusers would have something to fear, if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime, they will now face prosection**

This is a good point, but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process, regardless of the location of the trial, the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist, or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries, we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts.

**The punishment is harsher than the crime.**

No it isn't. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for 40 years is surely a capital offense, and should be punished as such.

**The perjury charge handles this**

I believe that this is too weak, it is not a capital offense, and it should be.

I am willing to change this view, but it will take some level of convincing. I am eager to hear the responses.  

MODIFICATION OF MY VIEW credit to /u/AMereRedditor:

I now believe that the minimum sentence for the crime that the accuser was accused of is inappropriate, but that the maximum sentence for the attempted version of the same crime is still very much appropriate. (If you are found guilty of knowingly, wrongfully accusing someone of murder, your sentence should be the maximum for attempted murder)

<submission><id>54</id><identifier>4c6of8</identifier><title>CMV: Batman's justification for not killing the Joker is illogical, irrational, and irresponsible</title><commentCount>80</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4c6of8/cmv_batmans_justification_for_not_killing_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>So a lot of classic superheros have a no-killing rule that can be traced entirely to the fact that their stories were originally aimed (at least, in their most famous iteration) at children. Things change--some stories play with the characters and introduce new twists, but let's agree on the two things that *define* Batman:

1. His parents are shot and killed
2. He does not kill

Let's ignore any what-if's or alternate universes where he does kill anyone (such as the new movie). We're talking about quintessential mainline Batman, not Batfleck here. 

Batman's justification for not killing--that it's a slippery slope, is insane. Batman is one of the most regimented and strong-willed humans in the universe. He has trained himself mentally to peaks most humans could only dream of. The idea that Batman's will is so shaky that killing the Joker would lend him to an unstoppable killing spree is ridiculous. Even if he killed him and decided that that was a now-appropriate way of dealing with super villains, he would eventually kill all the murdering super villains that cause havoc.

Batman's alternate isn't particularly less cruel. He bashes people in, snaps their spines, paralyzes them, breaks their body in horrific ways, but won't kill? Come on.

Though the quote isn't attributed to Batman (it may actually just be an /r/showerthought) a friend argued that "if you kill a killer, the number of killers in the world stays the same". That's dumb. I prefer Frank Castle's twist--if Frank Castle kills one killer, the number of killers is the same, but if he kills 100 killers, that's a net loss of 99. Just keep killing bad guys!

Another justification is that not killing separates him from criminals, but Batman *is* a criminal. Vigilantism is criminal. Batman already thinks that he is above the law, and is just fine with breaking the law to pursue his own warped sense of justice. What gives Bats the right to undermine the legal system right up until the death penalty?

The only argument I can sort of see is the idea that Batman refuses to shoot people because he was traumatized by his parents' death, but even then, there's other ways of killing people--like smashing their spines, which he's perfectly fine doing.

I get it--Batman's justification is that they can always "come back"--but they don't. They haven't. Fool me twice and everything. I could understand 2, 3 times with the Joker, but now it's long overdue.

Let's ignore any meta-arguments, including "Batman can't kill because then he isn't a hero" and "if he killed the Joker, there wouldn't be anymore comics with him!" We're talking strictly in-universe justifications.

<submission><id>55</id><identifier>3qp5ah</identifier><title>CMV: We should abolish prisons and build segregated towns for criminal</title><commentCount>87</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3qp5ah/cmv_we_should_abolish_prisons_and_build/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Why do you build prisons? People say it's to keep criminals from the rest of society. Then why should we imprison them when we have other options to do that. In my opinion, it is immoral to imprison people and deny them a future. People advocate abolishing death penalty because it is wrong to kill people. Guess what, you're still kill them with imprisonment. You're killing them with time, and worst, instead of a quick death, they are tortured mentally and abused physically every single day. What else? Ah yes, the prisoners can be let out if they are found innocent later?!! But when you go in jail at 18 and get cleared at 50, your life is over. With no jobs, no skills, no relationships, no matter how much money you get for compensation, it won't bring back all the youth that you lost. You'll be pretty much sitting on these money waiting for the day you die. That is even more brutal than death penalty. I hardly can call that a progressive thing.

Therefore, I propose an alternative, better solution. We should build a segregated, walled town somewhere far from the population, like in a closed valley or on an island. Then we transport all the criminals there and provide them the basic necessities for life. We can then let them form their own society and grow their own town, having their own jobs, entertainment and social life  and even elect their own government (under heavy supervision and regulation of course). With this, we can accomplish everything we build prisons for without inhumanely torturing and abusing the inmates. They are kept away from normal society, we can actually see if they are actually reformed or not by observing their behaviors in that segregated community, and innocent inmates would still be able to enjoy a normal life like they would have in the normal society until they are set free. And it would be **much** more easy for prisoners to go back into society after their sentences (I think some of them wouldn't even leave after doing their time) because they haven't been suppressed socially and mentally for years. What's more? That town's activities and work can even generate profits and taxes for the country. It's a win-win situation, both morally, ethically and economically. Why didn't we do this in the first place?</selfText></submission>

Yet, capital punishment is still a legal practice in 32 U.S. States, and has been used to kill over 1,200 accused criminals since 1977. A fundamental topic that must be assessed when judging the usage of the death penalty is the morality of the practice. Ultimately, the moral question encompassing the practice of capital punishment has less to do with whether those convicted of heinous crimes deserve to die than with whether the government deserves to kill those who it has imprisoned. The government does not have the right nor moral justification to execute criminals. The greatest achievement that comes from the usage of the death penalty is retribution, an achievement that compromises the core of our criminal justice system, which is a system meant to be used primarily for rehabilitation. To kill the person who has killed someone close to you is simply to continue the cycle of violence which ultimately destroys the avenger as well as the offender.

When looking at the statistics of capital punishment, one concept becomes clear: those without the capital, get the punishment. Capital punishment perpetuates social injustices by disproportionately targeting people of color and people who cannot afford good attorneys. The rich simply do not get the death penalty, which is why you’ll never see a person like O.J. Simpson sitting on death row. Death sentences are imposed in a criminal justice system that treats you better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent.

However, unlike other sentences which leave room for absolution for those who can prove their innocence at a later date, death is unusually severe in its finality. Once it is taken, a life cannot be given back. The finality and enormity involved with the punishment of death are particularly important to take into consideration when looking at the errors that are made in the conviction of innocent people in the criminal justice system. Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent. That is a demonstrated error rate of 1 innocent person for every 7 persons executed. An error percentage of this size may not be significant in some cases, however, in the case of capital punishment, where the consequences are matter of life and death, such mistakes cannot be taken lightly. 

The only way to ensure no error is made and innocent people are not killed is by not allowing the practice of capital punishment to occur in the first place.</selfText></submission>

Look at the Tawana Brawley case where a brutal, racist gang rape by six white men turned to be entirely fabricated by the black female victim. Sadistic rape is enough to warrant the death penalty in at least a few jurisdictions, and was used to falsely convict and lynch black people in the past. By allowing for a death penalty, you're opening up a horrific can of worms and the potential for abuse. Texan governor Rick Perry has shown to be quite trigger-happy with it, killing clinically retarded criminals and even one guy after he was already acquitted. 

Do people want their catharsis? Undoubtedly, but I think it's a better idea to just lock monsters up in Supermax under a four point restraint 23 hours a day, so they can regret their existence and go mad from all the guilt and boredom. Contract it out to private companies, so taxpayers pay for as little of this as possible.

I believe in markets totally.  My business survives on the "managerial and technical efficiency" model of economic markets.  We don't really have any real market power and we're in highly competitive and transparent markets.  So I'm a believer in the power of markets.

Patents, trademarks &amp; copyright I believe to be limiters in the effectiveness of markets.  And surely people would like to be compensated for their creations, but I don't think the absence of these things mean that people can't profit from their creations. Profit of art, books and music far precedes the use of these market mechanisms.  This to me includes rent seeking activities like licensing and general regulation. 
 
So on the economic side of things I see the most benefit to the highest number of people being a system which is totally efficient.  And that would be a free market.  Not in the crony capitalism sense (or even an idealistic capitalistic system), but in the "anything goes" sense.  For every problem this creates, the market finds a way to solve that problem.  I've seen this time and time again in markets.  

I see this as a system that creates a much much larger number of companies, but creates much smaller companies.  This system would not support the 3Ms or DOW chemicals of the world as we see them.  That being said, companies like 3M and DOW would exist, just on a smaller scale.  They would survive, like my company based on their technical and managerial efficiency.  They would also likely have market power, but without government aided monopolies like the patent system they wouldn’t ever grow to the size that we see them today.

It is my opinion these systems simply aren't the point of government.  Which in my opinion should serve only a few purposes.

**Purpose of Government**

* Protecting the resources of earth, and creating policies which are self-sustaining.  This means resources are consumed at the rate they occur naturally or can be reproduced.  We have built a system that will survive so long as "we can cheaply and reliably extract cheap resources from the earth."  We externalize these costs and have built a system which is unsustainable.  When cheap oil ceases to exist, it will collapse (in my opinion).  We are a guest of the earth, we should leave it in the condition it was when we arrived.  This extends of course to pollution and trash.  That might mean it’s most cost effective to have glass cups rather than solo cups in this world.  I have not found an article that extrapolates what the true cost of oil products would be in a truly sustainable system. But I’d imagine its hundreds or thousands of times higher.
* Protecting the population from foreign invasion.  This means having an army that is adequate to defend itself, without being involved in empire building. 
* Organizing and managing the civil services &amp; public goods.  This includes fire, police, social services, schools etc.  I don't consider these institutions to be bad because history has shown that public goods perform poorly as private interests.
* Collecting and managing taxes.  Court systems may or may not involve contracts (see earlier point).  Crimes like child abuse, domestic violence, rape, robbery and murder are all Malum En Se laws and would be enforced by the police and court system.
Taxes
* All taxes should be based on consumption, not income.  Sales taxes, road tolls etc.  Should economics dictate an income tax as well, it should be flat and non-substantial in nature. Increasing tax brackets are ethically wrong in my opinion.  “Better able to pay a higher percentage” doesn’t mean “should pay a higher percentage” in my opinion.  On a much more competitive market, a progressive tax rate may provide substantial disincentives since there will likely be no more billionaires in the world.  This world may not even have people making much more than a million dollars a year.

Think of all the richest people in the world, and think if they’d still be that rich in the absence of patents, copyrights and trademarks.  In the absence of black and grey markets (since regulated markets would no longer exist).  Those profits are distributed to the entire market.  Those benefits are much quicker reintegrated into the system.  You’d still likely be able to retire off that medical invention you created, but you’d no longer be fabulously wealthy at the expense of people’s lives.  

**Laws**

* Nearly all laws involving malum prohibitum are abolished.  I'd like to talk about this with people that have a background in law, but basically all these laws I consider absolutely unnecessary and they cause enormous inefficiencies in the market.  This includes noise complaints, fraud etc.
* Contract law may be unnecessary.  I'd like to start an open minded discussion about this.  What is the true necessity of contract law? Credit? 
Even if contract law is an unnecessary government burden to enforce, it may provide positive relief to negative free market issues.  Sure you can't make someone cut their grass without malum prohibitum laws, but you can choose to live in a community that does enforce that.  I am less confident on a for or against position here and would like to hear opinions on the matter.

* Tax avoidance and fraud would be one of the few laws I would consider legitimate, since they challenge the continued operation of the government which I believe services a legitimate purpose in this context.
* Corruption should be a capital offense. (I don't believe in the death penalty for all the standard reasons, ineffective, unfair to innocents in the system, no deterrent, more expensive etc)
In this context the government serves a legitimate purpose.  It protects the earth, ensures safety nets are sufficiently run to help those who lack the ability to succeed themselves in the market and defends the nation against foreign invasion.  

My concerns with this viewpoint are that it may not be possible without externalizing the cost of resources.  What I mean is that it may be possible this entire system exists out of the fact we assign a zero cost to the resources themselves.  That we only add in the cost of locating, extracting and refining it.  And that a world without cheap resources simply wouldn't be one in which profits really exist.  It may be more mercantile in nature, and if if WAS, does that mean that we couldn't subsidize a safety net?

**So why would such a radical restructuring be necessary or even preferred?**  I have a couple concerns.

* The will of the rich and powerful are imposed in the current system.  The rich and powerful do so because of market protection mechanisms.  State enforced monopolies. They are powerful because they are almost always aligned with profit mechanisms.  And those mechanisms are almost always aligned with government interests.
* It is unsustainable, not in the short term, but in the long term, with almost absolute certainty.
* We treat the earth as an infinite resource and trash can, when we are guests and its supplies are finite. 
* Endless regulation and law making create a world that is oppressive and lends itself to a permissive existence.  Everything that is legal can also with enough legal gymnastics be considered illegal.  We are all therefor criminals.  It is said that every day we break laws unknowingly due to the large and complex nature of the legal system.  We are all criminals, it is only whether or not we are chosen to be prosecuted.
* The end goal of markets is not the largest amount of PROFIT but the most efficient operation to its end.  Profit is simply the MOTIVE that drives the market.  We've created a system where we view the end goal as creating the most amount of profit for a few companies, instead of a system that creates the most efficient system for the most efficient number of companies. This distributes profit and increases the rate at which people enter and exit markets as well as increases the rate at which the market solves problems efficiently (meeting supply and demand and driving down prices).

**Discussion Scope**

Given the large nature of this post, let’s try and limit discussion to any of the points contained here and not try to venture too far into “but what about this?” Unless it really really adds to the discussion.  But I’ll try to respond to as many posts as possible.  I’m not trying to be right about this post, but I’ve just thought about this A LOT.  I’ve always been interested in the “system.”  And I’ve changed my views a couple times over the years but I feel pretty confident about this as providing an overall positive benefit to humanity if such a thing were possible.  I am actually interested in changing my view, If it is “incorrect” or “improbable” because of some reason.  Changing that view might mean that “this wouldn’t work because people couldn’t do X” which means it would be relegated to “ideal but not implementable” systems.  I understand this is a highly theoretical discussion.

In school we learned that there are 4 "reasons" we might send someone to prison. Retribution, Isolation, Rehabilitation, Deterrance. I think Isolation is the only valid reason.

* Retribution because obviously wrongdoers deserve to be punished, yes? I don't buy this because I think the justice system can't sink to the level of a criminal. It's hypocritical if sentencing laws sanction wrong action to be taken against a criminal because they've done wrong. Two wrongs making a right in the justice system undermines the whole idea of right and wrong and it would be better on principle if the justice system led by example. It's a justice system, not a revenge system.
* Deterrence because obviously, people who would become criminals might not want to be sent to prison, and so might modify their behaviour so that they are not sent to prison. This argument, while it makes sense, is not empirically true. States in the US with the death penalty have just as high murder rates as States without it. This is because a lot of crimes are committed opportunistically or in the heat of the moment: the majority of people don't think rationally through the consequences before they commit a crime.
* Rehabilitation - because in prison a criminal learns discipline and can learn from his mistakes. This is also not empirically true. Prisons can form "colleges of crime" where minor offenders come out of prison worse than when they went in because they learn from more serious offenders how best to commit crime. Reoffending rates of prison sentences are much higher than that of community service orders and a lot of criminals even prefer the routine of prison compared to the instability that exists in many of their home lives on the outside.

Lastly, prison is extremely costly and overcrowded. In the UK, it costs nearly £40,000 pounds (more than a whole year's salary for a lot of people) to incarcerate them. In addition, the prisons are overcrowded, but when you consider that 66% of the prison population is only there for 6 months or less for minor offences, it makes more sense to use alternatives to prison such as community service. They are cheaper, and reduce re offending more. CMV

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**EDIT:** So in the course of debate a number of things have come up. The first point is that without prison, because of the lack of a deterrent/retributive punishment two things will happen. Crime will increase because people don't mind getting caught and that the families of victims, unhappy with a lack of righteous punishment, will take the law into their own hands and dish out their own brand of less righteous punishment. So that everyone is up to speed, my answers have been that there is no excuse for vigilanteism and people must respect the rule of law. If they can't abide by this and they break the law they pose a threat to society and should therefore be jailed to isolate them. This isn't by any means the only solution, but is the first one I thought of.

The second point is that Community service is a "cop-out" punishment that will breed resentment towards the judicial system. I need to clarify a few things here. Community service is by no means the only alternative to a custodial sentence. Probation, a suspended sentence, tagging, curfews, generalised restrictions of liberty and "restorative justice" (a sentence that is used especially in cases of young offenders where they have to talk to their victims and in so doing learn the true consequences of their actions) are all available to the courts. I am assuming that the courts would choose an appropriate variety of these for the same length of time as the comparable prison sentence, just as they current choose an appropriate sentence under the current system.</selfText></submission>

From this place of self-aware critical assessment, I believe I have noted a distinctly "Liberal" bias in most news reporting across almost all major news networks, with the notable exception of Fox News. 

I do not judge this to be a necessarily bad thing, as the general public appears to have a distinctly Liberal perspective on events and prefers news that reflects this bias. It is also no suprise that people who view the world through this bias would see it as "neutral" and view any report presented from an alternative bias as "skewed." Without acknowledging one's own bias, it is often mistaken for plain or objective Truth, rather than being seen as one *possible* interpretation among several (or at least two, in this example).

I do not argue that Fox News lacks bias, only that there do not appear to be **any** purely neutral and completely objective news reporting entities that just "tell the facts" without presenting those bare facts through one filter or another. My conclusion is that, at most, Fox News is **equally** biased, just from a different perspective.

I can't say these are all entirely representative or completely make my case, but I hope it goes to support my claim that both sides have their own way of assessing and interpreting information that is sometimes accurate and sometimes off center of neutral or objective towards their own preferred view of the world. It's all about that spin, baby!

****

Edit pending here to clarify and define what I think are commonly understood "Liberal" and "Conservative" traits that may influence or *bias* interpretation of otherwise "neutral" or "objective" facts.

*****

So lets start with some definitions to focus the discussion. 

From Wikipedia on [Liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism):

"Though **all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage,** scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain "separate and often contradictory streams of thought". The objectives of liberal theorists and philosophers have differed across various times, cultures, and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the **numerous adjectives** that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term liberalism, including classical, egalitarian, economic, social, **welfare-state**, ethical, humanist, deontological, perfectionist, **democratic**, and institutional, to name a few."

"Less friendly to the goals of liberalism has been conservatism... **assailing the liberal pretensions to the power of rationality and to the natural equality of all humans.** Conservatives have also attacked what they perceive to be the **reckless liberal pursuit of progress and material gains**, arguing that such preoccupations **undermine traditional social values rooted in community and continuity**. However, a few variations of conservatism, like liberal conservativism, expound some of the same ideas and principles championed by classical liberalism, including **'small government and thriving capitalism'**."

"Social democracy, **an ideology advocating progressive reform of capitalism**, emerged in the 20th century and was **influenced by socialism**. Yet unlike socialism, it was not collectivist nor anti-capitalist. Broadly defined as **a project that aims to correct, through government reformism**, what it regards as the **intrinsic defects of capitalism** by reducing inequalities, social democracy was also not against the state."

"In the United States, **modern liberalism** traces its history to the popular presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who **initiated the New Deal in response to the Great Depression** and won an unprecedented four elections. The New Deal coalition established by Franklin Roosevelt left a decisive legacy and influenced many future American presidents, including John F. Kennedy, **a self-described liberal**..."

"Economic woes in the early 21st century led to a resurgence of social liberalism with the election of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election."

"Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to **expand civil rights**. In the 1960s and 1970s, the cause of Second Wave feminism in the United States was advanced in large part by liberal feminist organizations such as National Organization for Women. In addition to **supporting gender equality**, liberals also have **advocated for racial equality** in their drive to promote civil rights, and a global civil rights movement in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Among the various regional and national movements, the civil rights movement in the United States during the 1960s strongly highlighted the **liberal efforts for equal rights**...  The Great Society project launched by President Lyndon B. Johnson oversaw **the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, the establishment of Head Start and the Job Corps as part of the War on Poverty, and the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964**—an altogether rapid series of events that some historians have dubbed the Liberal Hour."

"Other scholars have praised the influence of **liberal internationalism**, claiming that the rise of globalization 'constitutes a **triumph of the liberal vision** that first appeared in the eighteenth century' while also writing that liberalism is "the only comprehensive and hopeful vision of world affairs". **The gains of liberalism have been significant**. In 1975, roughly 40 countries around the world were characterized as liberal democracies, but that number had increased to more than 80 as of 2008.[162] Most of the world's richest and most powerful nations are liberal democracies with extensive social welfare programs.

*****

And, from the Wikipedia page on [Conservatism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism):

"Conservatism as a political and social philosophy **promotes retaining traditional social institutions**. A person who follows the philosophies of conservatism is referred to as a traditionalist or conservative."

"Some conservatives **seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity**, while others, called reactionaries, **oppose modernism and seek a return to 'the way things were'**."

"In the United States, conservatism is **rooted in the American Revolution and its commitment to republicanism, sovereignty of the people, and the rights and liberties of Englishmen while expelling the king and his supporters**... Modern American liberals in the New Deal do not disagree with that consensus view, but **conservatives spend much more emphasis on the Revolutionary origins, with the Tea Party advocates use an episode from the 1770s for their name** and some even dress in costumes from that era at their rallies."

Historian Gregory Schneider identifies several constants in American conservatism: **respect for tradition, support of republicanism, 'the rule of law and the Christian religion,' and a defense of 'Western civilization from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments'**."

"Libertarian conservatism describes certain political ideologies within the United States and Canada which combine libertarian economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its five main branches are Constitutionalism, paleolibertarianism, neolibertarianism, small government conservatism and Christian libertarianism. They generally differ from paleoconservatives, in that they are in favor of more personal and economic freedom."

"In contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict laissez-faire policies such as **free trade, opposition to any national bank and opposition to business regulations**. They are vehemently **opposed to environmental regulations, corporate welfare, subsidies, and other areas of economic intervention**."

"Fiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt. Edmund Burke, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, argued that a **government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer...**"

"Social conservatism is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives believe that **the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors**. A social conservative wants to **preserve traditional morality and social mores, often through civil law or regulation**. Social change is generally regarded as suspect."

"Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the word) in many countries generally **favor the pro-life position** in the abortion controversy and **oppose human embryonic stem cell research** (particularly if publicly funded); **oppose both eugenics and human enhancement** (transhumanism) while supporting bioconservatism; **support a traditional definition of marriage** as being one man and one woman; **view the nuclear family model as society's foundational unit;** oppose expansion of civil marriage and child adoption rights to **couples in same-sex relationships**; promote public **morality and traditional family values**; oppose **atheism**, especially militant atheism, secularism and the separation of church and state; **support the prohibition of drugs, prostitution, and euthanasia**; and support the **censorship of pornography** and what they consider to be **obscenity or indecency**. Most conservatives in the U.S. **support the death penalty**."

"Religious conservatives principally seek to **apply the teachings of particular religions to politics**, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times **by having those teachings influence laws**."

"The meaning of 'conservatism' in America has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo (2011) notes, **'what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism.'** Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the Republican Party. However, during the era of segregation many Southern Democrats were conservatives, and they played a key role in the Conservative Coalition that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963."

"Major movements within American conservatism include **support for tradition, law-and-order, Christianity, anti-communism, and a defense of 'Western civilization from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments.'** Economic conservatives and libertarians **favor small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise**. Some social conservatives see traditional **social values threatened by secularism**, so they **support school prayer and oppose abortion and homosexuality**. Neoconservatives want to **expand American ideals throughout the world** and show a strong support for Israel."

"Paleoconservatives, in opposition to multiculturalism, press for **restrictions on immigration**. Most U.S. conservatives prefer Republicans over Democrats, and most factions **favor a strong foreign policy and a strong military**. The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to **prevent the spread of 'Godless Communism'**, which Reagan later labeled an 'evil empire'."

"Other modern conservative beliefs include **opposition to a world government and skepticism about the importance or validity of various environmental issues**."

"Most recently, the Tea Party movement, founded in 2009, has proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas. Their stated goals include **rigorous adherence to the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes, and opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care**. Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010."

*****

**TL;DR**

**Key concepts in Liberalism:** promote and expand the welfare state, promote humanism over Christianity, support progressive government reform of capitalism closely aligned with socialist ideals, support government programs initiated by The New Deal, support and helped elect Obama, expand civil rights using government authority, support gender equality using government programs, advocated for racial equality using government authority, support the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, Head Start, the Job Corps as part of the War on Poverty using government resources and authority. (In addition to holding opposite views of Conservative ideals listed below - favor the pro-choice position, support stem cell research, oppose a traditional definition of marriage, oppose the view that the nuclear family is the only valid model, support same-sex relationships, oppose some 'traditional' family values, support atheism and secularism, oppose the prohibition of drugs, prostitution, and euthanasia, oppose the censorship of pornography and obscenity, oppose the death penalty, oppose efforts to reduce the size or scope of government, believe wealthy persons should pay higher taxes, support many forms of government regulation, oppose reduced regulation governing 'free enterprise', oppose school prayer, oppose restrictions on immigration, support 'global influence' on American ideals, credulous of environmental concerns, support for a growing role for the federal government in health care.)


**Key concepts in Conservatism:** promotes retaining traditional social institutions, emphasizing stability and continuity, oppose modernism, rooted in the American Revolution and its commitment to republicanism, advocates sovereignty of the people over government authority, respect for tradition, support 'the rule of law and the Christian religion,' and a defense of Western civilization from totalitarian governments, support free trade, opposition to business regulations, opposed to environmental regulations, corporate welfare, subsidies, believes the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors, favor the pro-life position, oppose stem cell research, oppose both eugenics and human enhancement, support a traditional definition of marriage, view the nuclear family model as society's foundational unit, oppose same-sex relationships, promote morality and traditional family values,  oppose atheism and secularism, support the prohibition of drugs, prostitution, and euthanasia, support the censorship of pornography and obscenity, support the death penalty, favor small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise, support school prayer, expand American ideals throughout the world, support restrictions on immigration, oppose a world government, skepticism about various environmental issues, opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care.

If anyone actually took the time to read all that, or at least the TL; DR section, I am still searching for good concrete examples of how a single story would look from either bias compared to a more objective "mere facts" report. Edit pending.

If religions are willing to change then there is no problem, if they aren't willing to change then they should be prosecuted.

Why I hold these views, I believe that society tolerating these behaviors is bad, and added to that, the fact that the ones propagating these views are religious, which by many people are seen as a moral authority. This means they can do more damage than a regular person.

If there is absolutely no question about the identity and sanity of the criminal, then I don't see the problem with it. Examples of cases like this are maybe: Hitler, Saddam Hussein or Breivik. I think the ultimate crime should be punished with the ultimate penalty, doing anything else would be morally wrong. Also if you look at it from a more practical side: legal punishments have two goals: Special prevention (preventing the criminal from commiting another crime) and General prevention (showing the public that committing a crime is not worth it and that there are consrquences to your actions). The death penalty would suit both goals of legal punishment, because there is no way of better special prevention than the death penalty, and it shows society the consequences of commiting certain crimes.

Where are all the psychologist and criminologist? Is this part of the culture of America? Because countries like Norway where the focus is rehab, works!

I ask you reddit, a 17 year old kills someone, you all scream life in prison without parole or death penalty. What about a 15 year old? 12?

What if I told you that 12 year old will never kill anyone again, what punishment does he deserve in your eyes?

Perhaps the individual took a life, or committed some other crime that would warrant the punishment, but doesn't taking their life bring you down to their level? There's a difference between locking a guy up and killing him. 

Then you get into wrongful executions. Some people are wrongfully convicted and put in prison for a few decades, but if and when proof is found, they are freed and can at least attempt to re enter society with a few years left. If you wrongfully execute somebody, there's no turning back. They're gone forever. 

In summary, I don't think we are to say who gets to live and die, especially criminals, some of whom are convicted wrongfully.

I've found that I agree with Democrats in just about every fashion except for abortion. I am solidly pro-life, and yet I feel like I'm misinformed. Why are my views so similar to these people except for one area?  
*NOTE: I am an atheist, not religious at all - so that isn't any reason for my beliefs*

The way is see it is - the matter of "when life begins" is never going to be solidly decided. It's a blurred line - maybe life begins as early as conception, maybe as far forward as birth. I think that there's a possibility for either. Now, isn't it a better idea to just play it safe, and not have any abortions? That way, if it turns out that life begins at birth, well too bad. However, if it begins at conception - good on us, we saved some lives.

Those who believe in pro-choice would say that a woman has a right to decide what happens to her body. I certainly agree, everyone has that right. But if you got pregnant, it means one of two things - you got pregnant with consent, or without (rape).

If you got pregnant with consent - live with your mistake! It's nine months out of your life, and then you can give the baby up for adoption, to a family that wants it. If you were raped - well, that's a harder question. But you really have two options:  

* Like I said earlier, we will probably never know for sure, but there's a chance life begins anywhere from conception to birth - so one option is the *possibility* of ending a human life.  

* The other option is making a rape victim carry a baby for nine months, then give birth. After birth, the baby can be given up for adoption, and that's the end of it.

I believe in the sanctity of human life - that's why I vehemently oppose the death penalty, and why I support gun control - and I believe that it is a much bigger sin to even *possibly* kill something than it is to make someone go through nine months of pregnancy.

But there's a reason I'm posting here, to Change My View, rather than any other place. I'm looking for my view to be changed. If I vote for a Democratic president, I want to know I agree with everything they do rather than most of it. So, Reddit, CHANGE MY VIEW!

**edit:** Thank you /r/CMV so much for helping me see new views on the subject. Thanks also for ruthlessly downvoting me based only on my opinion.  Read www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette please? Anyway, I haven't experienced any major paradigm shift or anything, but I definitely have a better appreciation of the pro-choice philosophy.</selfText></submission>

CMV</title><commentCount>67</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1zhoyc/if_death_penalty_opponents_were_ideologically/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I have never heard a single argument in favor of totally abolishing the death penalty in all circumstances that couldn't also be used against having armed police or the armed forces in any circumstances, including emergencies or wartime.

"What if they kill an innocent person?"
"Killing another person is wrong, no matter what they've done."
"You can never know for 100% certain if the person you are killing isn't really innocent."
"It costs too much money to kill or put a person to death." (have you seen our defense budget?)
"Vengeance is wrong; we shouldn't seek to kill others, but rather, we should seek to reform them."
"Being killed is a violation of human dignity."

If you think about it, the death penalty is actually fairer than armed police. If the police shoot a suspect and kill him, he could have been innocent. Or, they could accidentally shoot a bystander. And if the suspect dies, remember that he didn't even get a trial! At least the death row inmate has had his day in court.

And the army? I mean, how many civilians are killed in wars every year? Way more than the actual combatants! Even when the army deliberately avoids trying to kill civilians, accidents still happen.

I think that most death penalty opponents aren't actually anti-death, they are just anti-judicial. The government dealing death is okay as long as the executive branch does it, but the second that the judicial branch does, it becomes wrong somehow? Doesn't make one iota of sense.

Yet that's how many South American nations conduct themselves. They haven't had the death penalty for centuries, yet they have shady death squads under control of dictators that force disappearances of political opponents or other undesirables. They're being hypocrites. 

So, if you oppose the death penalty but support armed police and the armed forces, CMV that you're a hypocrite. Tell me why you oppose the death penalty, and why that reason shouldn't also cause you to be a total pacifist?

**EDIT: One of the main responses I have been getting is that it's okay for the police or military to kill someone who poses an immediate threat, but an unarmed prisoner poses no immediate threat. So in their minds, it's worse to kill someone who isn't an immediate threat. But I'll respond with a thought experiment.**

Situation A: I walk into my house and discover that a crazed man has stabbed my family to death. Fearing for my own life, and enraged at his actions, I reach for my concealed handgun and shoot him, and he dies.

Situation B: I walk into my house, see the murder scene, draw my gun, and the man runs away before I can shoot him. But I spend the next year tracking him down, and finally find him a year later, where I confront him and shoot him when he's unarmed.

Which situation is morally worse? From the murderer's perspective, he'd prefer situation B, since he gets to live a year longer. From my perspective, it doesn't matter as long as the murderer dies. My motivations for killing him are nearly identical in both situations, too.

**This is also assuming that unarmed prisoners aren't a threat. They could always escape, or hurt other prisoners, or guards. If they are a mob boss, they could run their organization from prison, which might indirectly lead to more deaths.**</selfText></submission>

Politicians who claim to be "tough on crime" while increasing the penalties are just playing against peoples' anger and desire for revenge without much consideration of making society safer or solving the problems that led to the crimes in the first place.

Here is my reason for offering this CMV: It's coming up to election time (US and Canada). Politicians will be ramping these statements up at the exact same time that private prisons and policing are very much in the public eye. I want to make informed opinions.

* For sufficiently complex animals, death results in a loss of well-being equal to or greater than it does in the case of many humans (infants and the profoundly handicapped). 
* We do not make an exception to murder laws in the case of infants and the profoundly handicapped, nor do we typically treat such murders as lesser offenses.
* The prohibition against murder is warranted (if by nothing else) by the fact that killing people results in a loss of well-being, and the generally high severity of punishment for murder is due to the fact that murder is generally one of the most harmful offenses.
* Therefore, I think the planned and deliberate killing of animals should be illegal and carry penalties similar to those for first degree murder.

But I'm curious where she actually wants progress to be made.

So my basic assumption here, to actually be incremental progress you have to be more progressive then your predecessor, in this case, Obama.

But when you look at her positions, on the majority of the issues, she is at the same position or just right to Obama.  I should note, this is where I judge her and Obama's positions, not where they officially stand.   You can try to convince me that my rankings are incorrect though.


Issues where Hillary is more progressive then Obama:

 * Minimum wage increase
 * Gun Control
 * Student Loans

_____

Issues where Obama and Hillary line up:

 * Healthcare (Obamacare/Medicaid/Vaccines)
 * Free Trade
 * Immigration
 * Women's Rights (Abortion;PP Funding;Gender Pay/Diversity)
 * Voter Rights
 * Patriot Act/Mass Surveillance

Issues where Hillary is more conservative then Obama:

 * Campaign finance
 * American imperialism/interventionism
 * Israeli/Palestine Conflict
 * Wall street deregulation
 * Prison Privatization
 * LGBT Rights
 * Drug/Pot legalization
 * Welfare reform
 * Death Penalty
 * Net Neutrality

CMV</title><commentCount>66</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1xf9jf/i_believe_it_is_unjustifiable_to_support_abortion/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>To be clear, I'm referring to both in a vacuum and as ideals. That is, I mean the idea of the death penalty as the harshest possible sentence for a capital crime in a world where the person sentenced to death is always guilty of the accused crime. I acknowledge that the death penalty in our actual world is highly flawed, but I do not believe this is because of the idea itself. Rather, I believe the flaws of the system are a result of human error, which means they are correctable. 

Likewise, I'm referring to abortion in the sense of a safe, professional environment (in other words, no home/amateur abortions). 

I think that abortion, regardless of when performed, robs a potential human being of its life. Whether you think that a fetus is a human being or not, it is a living mass of tissue that, without intervention, would become a human being with all of the possibilities of happiness and life that we all have. Furthermore, a fetus is innocent of any crime or action that would make it deserve death. Abortion is done for two reasons: either the Mother doesn't want the child or she can't safely have the child. In either case, the child is not at fault (I don't think you can blame developmental/delivery complications on the fetus). 

The death penalty is a punishment for something that a society has deemed crosses a very specific line (like murder). In the case of a death sentence (again, in an ideal), the victim has done something to warrant the sentence. They have broken the rules of the society they live in so severely that they cannot be allowed to have any further part of that society. 

By supporting abortion, but not the death penalty, I think someone is justifying one denial of life but not the other.</selfText></submission>

I don't believe in the eye for an eye theory or that innocent people make the system flawed. This might also partially have to do with my believe in the incompetence of the prison systems with "rehabilitation". How can you expect anybody to come back to normal society when they're in a hostile environment for that many years of their life?

First let me describe ways in which I hear this accusation used.  Most commonly it refers to liberals standing up for people who committed crimes but were then wronged by police, or, more importantly, it can refer to terrorists or suspected terrorists.  The 3 main reasons why protecting these people is so important are 1.  You have no idea if they are truly guilty, and most of the time liberals are trying to protect them is before they've been convicted of any actual crimes.  2.  Hive mind and group think run wild when people think a crime has been committed, therefore someone needs to stand up for someone who may be innocent, regardless of who that person is and what they've been accused of.  3.  Even if the person is found guilty, many people believe they should still be treated with humane punishment.  Standing up for the Boston Bomber to not receive the death penalty is important to showing that situations don't change your view of the punishment.  </selfText></submission>

Humans imo should help each other out and not go out of their way to hurt each other, and if someone does go out of their way to hurt someone else, there is a motive behind it, whether it's external or internal. Considering the fact that everyone is different, with rehabilitation, we can find out what made that individual do what they did, and possibly prevent such behavior from happening in the future, allowing them to become a productive member of society. </selfText></submission>

A "unalienable right": there is simply no such thing. 

* Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, (or life, liberty and property,) have been declared "unalienable", but each of these can be denied by governments, and individuals.
* The right to life is considered the most basic right. But many countries, and all the original 13 colonies in the US , had death penalties.

While I believe that free will and self determination are better justifications for laws than "divine rights" or "because God said so", there is nothing logically that supposes unalienable, or natural, rights.

However, even the slim possibility of accidentally killing an innocent is something which I cannot abide. What makes us better than the people we're condemning if we accept that collateral damage is a possibility?

I would suggest the following requirements:

- The accused must be over 25 years of age (the median age at which many neurologists say your brain stops developing).
- The accused must be a repeat offender of violent crimes.
- The accused must be declared sane by a neutral, respected psychologist.

I feel that these requirements would all but eliminate the possibility of accidentally killing an innocent, while keeping the death penalty as a possibility for those that truly deserve it.

CMV</title><commentCount>63</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1uh0ln/i_believe_official_misconduct_such_as_political/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>* Modern society provides great benefit to humanity, therefor I do not reject the imposition of state power.
* Certain values are held as critical and assumed values of the system : Fairness at trial, use of state violence only when necessary, loyalty to the people instead of profit or political interest groups etc
* These values are critical to the acceptance of both the rule of law and the system itself to the individual.  Since no one would accept a system which  acts with indiscriminate indifference to the values of fairness.
* Society requires that the ruling class act blindly to the persuasion of popular or profitable political interests and act in the interests of society and the general population.
* A republic is designed in such a way that a fraction of the population controls the entire population.
* To violate these rules and to act in self interest against principles of fairness, instead of the interest of society causes contempt for modern society because the system becomes unjust.

Therefor it goes to reason that these offenses are of the most serious.  This is the state's version of treason.  It is an act of war against the people.

Objections

 &gt;If people in these positions had to worry about the possibility of constantly being accused of a capital crime, nothing would get done.  No one would become public servants.

I believe instead the best people would become public servants.  Only those with the highest ethical integrity and confidence in their abilities would serve.  And they would do so with little to no rational fear of being accused of such conduct, because they are of sound moral principle.  It is only a person who believes they are incapable of absolute morality and professionalism that would worry about such a thing.  I argue that any efficiency lost (if there was any) would be at great social benefit.

&gt;Murder is a more serious crime because it is direct.  Even if these issue affect millions, no one is directly and physically hurt.  

True, but the same could be said about treason, yet it is a capital offense.  The reasoning being is that it threatens the integrity of the system.  It is therefor one of the most serious and egregious offenses.   This is not to say that I believe that removing the capital offense status of treason justifies these offenses as being non capital offenses. 

&gt; Someone who is innocent could have their lives put in jeopardy, all because they want to serve the public.  They could end up in jail for life or worse.

This is a critique on the justice system.  Your problem is with a system that is capable and often does subject innocent people to unfair punishment and sometimes death.  In a world where justice is truly blind, fair and all people who are innocent are exonerated with little effort needed to prove their innocence, this objection carries no weight.  

&gt;We hold that these people should be held to a "higher standard." 

 I reject this notion and replace it with "the highest standard."  If the continuity of the system is the highest priority, people who serve it, should be held to the highest standard.

*For the sake of clarification I do not believe in the death penalty, because it is impossible to know with 100% certainty the innocence or guilt of someone, I believe it is immoral for the state to execute even one person.  It also does not act as a deterrent and lowers us to the level of condoning state sanctioned murder.  This argument goes only so far as to state that I believe these offenses should be capital offenses, and are treated in manners similar to other capital offenses.*

<submission><id>79</id><identifier>4umyhy</identifier><title>CMV: Being personally pro-life, but believing others should have a right to choose is inconsistent.</title><commentCount>64</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4umyhy/cmv_being_personally_prolife_but_believing_others/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>First I'd like to clarify: This view is not about whether or not abortion is moral or immoral. It is about whether two views can both consistently be held (sort of like how some people argue pro-life and pro-death penalty are inconsistent.) 

When a person says that they are "personally pro-life", what they usually mean is that they would not have an abortion themselves, or recommend one to a person in that position. If they viewed a fetus as simply a collection of cells, then it would be ridiculous to have this opinion. How could it be a bad personal decision to get rid of a collection of cells that have no rights? So therefore if one is "personally pro-life", then they must also hold a belief that a fetus is more than just a collection of cells, and is actually another person.
 
I'm aware that some people argue that even if a fetus constitutes a person, then abortion would still be morally acceptable. For example, "A Defense of Abortion" by Judith Jarvis Thompson. But for someone who is "Personally pro life", they believe in fetal personhood and also that abortion is immoral. Without believing in this immorality, there would be know viable reason for them to not get an abortion if it was convenient for them. 

So how could they also believe that other people should be able to have abortions when it is an immoral act? And not immoral in the way that some would say prostitution or drug use is immoral. If they believe that abortion is indeed the ending of another human's life, and they believe that is immoral, then doesn't it have to be on the same scale as killing a child or an infant? 

Again I would like to STRONGLY emphasize that I'm not saying abortion is murder, I'm not defending a pro-life stance, my view is only that being "personally pro life" and believing other people should have the option of abortion is inconsistent. 

Sorry if this post comes off as rambling or disorganized, this is my first time posting to CMV.

<submission><id>80</id><identifier>28oud1</identifier><title>CMV: Crimes should not be treated as more severe merely because they resulted in deaths</title><commentCount>64</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/28oud1/cmv_crimes_should_not_be_treated_as_more_severe/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>A recent case that has been making headlines in Canada is one of a [woman who parked on a road](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-woman-found-guilty-after-cyclist-passenger-died-while-she-helped-ducks/article19258695/) without even putting hazard lights on, resulting in the deaths of two people when a motorcyclist crashed into the back of her car.

The charges against her are criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. These charges are considered more severe because they resulted in death. Dangerous driving in which no injury occurs [has a maximum sentence of 5 years](http://www.defencelaw.com/penalty-driving.html) while dangerous driving causing death has a maximum sentence of 14 years (from the first link).

However, from the perspective of the person committing the crime, there is no difference between these two circumstances. If nobody happened to drive into the car of the woman in the news story, she would be facing less serious charges. Yet, for the exact same actions (on her part), she's facing very serious charges simply because people died.

I don't see why causing injury or death makes a crime more or less severe when the intent is unchanged. Obviously the intent will affect the sentencing of this woman, but why should the charges be any different?

A similar argument can be made about drunk driving. Driving drunk is a serious crime. Yet, (in my province, for example) a first time drunk driver will typically face a fine and driving suspension. If they an unlucky person happens to cross the street in front of this driver, they could instead be looking at up to life time imprisonment. In each case, the drunk driver made the same, reckless choice of driving drunk, but an accidental death (which could just as easily happen to anyone who drives drunk) makes one situation worse (in terms of criminal charges).

So why should some people get off easily (or get punished more severely) because of accidental deaths that occurred when they committed a crime?

EDIT: To elaborate on my exact views, I believe that the woman in this case should be charged with some type of dangerous driving charge and that drunk driving should be punished more severely, as it is an easily preventable decision that has a greatly increased chance of killing or injuring someone (to the point that I'd argue that getting behind the wheel while drunk is akin to considering killing people).

<submission><id>81</id><identifier>354qwm</identifier><title>CMV: I believe that taxpaying individuals should have some form of control over where their taxes go.</title><commentCount>61</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/354qwm/cmv_i_believe_that_taxpaying_individuals_should/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>**MAJOR EDIT, PLEASE READ**

/u/Ozimandius has officially changed my view ([permalink to his comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/354qwm/cmv_i_believe_that_taxpaying_individuals_should/cr1bm6m)

Ultimately my view is now not that individuals should have some control over where a portion of their tax money goes, but that at a minimum people should at least be able to know where their tax money goes (and then we have all the people discussing the solutions of voting and 'pressuring' our representatives

----------------

First of all, when I refer to individuals, I am not including corporations or the such. 

One discussion I have seen/heard is that there are problems with taxes paying for something with which one disagrees (I know some people disagree with taxes altogether but that's not what I am here to discuss). This notion does make sense to me - if I disagree with the death penalty (which I do, but that is not the subject of this post, I am just using the death penalty as an example), I would not want my tax money to have funded a state's killing of another individual. Since, as far as I know, I have no control over this (I live in the US), it makes me upset that my views are not accounted for just because I do not have the same opinion as the majority.

So how does my view work? Well, first of all, when I say "*some*" control I mean that I should be able decide where it is that a certain percentage of my tax money goes. This percentage can be, let's say, 25% (I just put in a number for ease of discussion, I don't have a specific number in mind). So 75% will be allocated without me having control over it. This may cover things like defense, national debt, education, social security, and other programs. The remaining percentage I will be allowed to allocate to various programs including but not necessarily the ones I mentioned above. This, I believe, will allow individuals to better represent themselves in the country, giving more money to programs one believes are "worthy" and less to ones which one believes are not.

How will this be done? There are several possible ways, one of which might just be a form that can be mailed or a unique code one can input into a government website when receiving annual tax forms. Not filling out the form will mean that one accepts the default (which will be defined in this case as "money will be allocated the way it already is being allocated").

Allowing for this system will

* let taxpaying individuals be at least more satisfied knowing they pay to support something they support

* show politicians what the general feel of their constituents is. 


Note: all of this does **not** mean that people will have the option to pay less taxes overall. The amounts people pay will be the same. The difference will be how much of one's tax money goes to specific locations. 

Overall, I think this idea is pretty reasonable. As a reminder, the 25% figure I gave earlier is not an exact figure I have in mind; it is just used for ease of example.

So yeah, CMV.


---------------

**General edit:** I have awarded a few deltas to some individuals who I agreed were right in the difficulties in implementing such a system. There will indeed be issues with budgets and a fair way for the system to work. 

While I still think that people should have some form of control, I have had my views changed regarding the format of implementing this system.

<submission><id>82</id><identifier>2z1n6s</identifier><title>CMV: The death penalty is only a harsh punishment for people who are wrongly convicted. For the guilty, it is by no means the ultimate punishment. It is inherently unjust and should be universally abolished.</title><commentCount>61</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2z1n6s/cmv_the_death_penalty_is_only_a_harsh_punishment/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>(This is USA-specific, but feel free to include your perspective if you are not a USA-ian)

For context: Among my family, friends, and loved ones are victims of murder, robbery, rape, and arson.  I myself have been assaulted and robbed in the street on an occasion where I realistically thought my life was in danger.  If someone killed or hurt someone in the circle of people I consider "family", I would probably want to do all sorts of horrible things to them in retribution. However, I do not believe civilization should operate that way.  I think that if I did take out that kind of retribution on such a person, I would also be violating the rules of civilized society in an inexcusable way.

I think the penalty of death, for any crime whatsoever, is heinously unjust and has no place in a civilized society.

The first reason is that I do not believe that the US justice system is anywhere near flawless.  There are [legal mechanisms in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity) that make it nearly impossible to oust an obviously corrupt prosecutor, for example.  

Also, consider this from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:

&gt;This Court has never held that the Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a habeas court that he is “actually” innocent. 

The main reason I am no longer in favor of the death penalty is because as an actual punishment, it seems extraordinarily slight.

Have you ever had surgery?  If you have, it probably went something like this:  a nurse came in and started an IV.  Then they placed a mask over your face and told you to take deep breaths and count.  Or, maybe they put the mask on first and stuck in the IV after you were out.  

Then you experienced exactly nothing. 

Then you woke up.

Was the period when you were unconscious particularly unpleasant?  I'll bet it wasn't.

If you have never had surgery, consider the period before you were born. Billions of years went by before you were born. Did you find those years to be particularly punitive?  Why would you expect a permanent state of non-experience after your death to be worse?

How likely would you be, if offered, to trade that experience for 50 or 60 years confined to a concrete and steel shit-hole filled with idiots and assholes, all of them dangerous, and many of them looking to exploit you in some way?  What if this included the guards and staff as well as your fellow inmates?  Would you like to spend 10 years in such a situation?  How about 20?  How about 70?

A guilty person, once convicted, knows they have nothing to look forward to except life in prison.  A wrongly-convicted innocent person may still hold out hope that they can be released. The death penalty only offers relief to the guilty, and terror to the innocent.

<submission><id>83</id><identifier>3gri3k</identifier><title>CMV: Prostitution should be legalized, I don't feel most arguments against it hold water.</title><commentCount>62</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3gri3k/cmv_prostitution_should_be_legalized_i_dont_feel/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it ("It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that "Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because "Desperate people might feel obligated to work them", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions ("Massage parlors"). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments ("Selling your body is wrong", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions ("Women will be forced into sex slavery")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

The key issues on which I agree with her are abortion and fair pay. I am probably missing some here. Please feel free to accuse me of myopia on these issues and convince me that she adheres to a more liberal position on other extremely important issues.

Evidence from senatorial voting records or statements made before she announced her presidential run will be weighed more heavily than recent statements.

I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other easily lethal weapon, they have no place in society and have a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry (without even touching on the trauma and psychological damage the victims must suffer).
To me, this type of crime shows an extreme amount of depravity. You're brandishing a weapon, ready to kill a person you do not even know, for short term profit. This especially applies to home invasions and store robberies.
The reason I added the 'positively identified' caveat is that I don't want to leave any room for putting an innocent person to death, so for this case to kick in, I would need either CCTV confirming their identity, or multiple eye witnesses confirming their identity. 
I'm willing to admit this view may be on the extreme side, but I like to think I'm a reasonable person and I'm open to change. So reddit, please CMV.

**EDIT: I should have clarified, please assume LOADED weapons or a knife, and the offender is NOT a juvenile. To me, these are different cases and do not deserve the death penalty.**

<submission><id>86</id><identifier>31opwo</identifier><title>CMV: If studies were to show that the Death Penalty deterred more murders than it killed innocent people, it would be immoral to oppose it.</title><commentCount>59</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/31opwo/cmv_if_studies_were_to_show_that_the_death/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>The CMV sort of has an asterisks to start off with: 

I understand this is a "what if" situation. I completely understand that all of the studies we have on the death penalty right now basically show us conflicting info and don't mean shit. The idea behind my view is that if we ever get to a point if/when we can clearly see that the DP is a deterrent to crime (if it is, like I said we don't have reliable information)

Anyways, if we had a death penalty that killed 100 people a year, and the "error" rate was 1%, that would be mean 1 innocent person a year would be getting killed by the state in a purposeful manner. And that's terrible. That is one person who didn't need to die. 

However, if the DP were to deter two murders a year, that is essentially two lives "saved." Generally being an active participant is far worse than being a passive bystander, but society has gotten to a point where we no longer rely on ourselves for protection, but rather we put our trust in the state to protect us from crime. While you're perfectly able to protect yourself in some situations, the majority of us rely on the police to keep us safe. Even if it isn't a police officer watching us directly, the threat of imprisonment is what keeps a lot of people from hurting one another. 

So essentially what it would come down to is: would you rather have one innocent person killed by the state, or two innocent people killed by other people? And to me, the person behind the trigger doesn't matter, only the end result - and I see two dead to one dead, and one dead is a far better, or I guess "less worse," situation.

They're simply too smart, too powerful, and often too unorthodox for the police to effectively deal with them. It takes someone of superior ability and freedom to catch these villains.

A few arguments I'm anticipating:

**Super villains wouldn't exist unless Batman provoked their creation of a secret identity**

Perhaps, but I think it's reasonable to say many of them would have at least become criminals, abate less theme oriented. And many, like Mr. Freeze or Hush, had very specific events trigger them and I feel they would probably have done exactly what they did either way. This is all speculation however, my concrete refutation of this point is that there are hundreds of costumed vigilantes in the DC universe and if Batman didn't inspire them to take up a secret identity, someone else would have. Or, super villains from other places would target Gotham because it has no super hero protecting it.

**Batman isn't effective, the villains just go to jail and then escape the next night**

I've never understood why Batman catches the flack for this one. Batman cannot sentence them to the death penalty. I suppose you could say he ought to be killing them himself, but even just catching the villains over and over is more good than the police are doing, which is nothing. I don't think there's a single comic where the police are able to stop Joker all by themselves. They're helpless against these super villains, Batman is the only thing that can combat them. Even if he doesn't do it efficiently, he still does it to some degree.

2.  That said, I'm willing to accept that occasionally innocents will be executed.  That's regrettable, but the doctrine of double effect, in my view, applies to this and other similar cases (e.g., unintended but foreseeable killing of civilians in wartime).

3. I believe murder is a necessary but not sufficient condition for execution.  Not all murderers should be executed (there may be mitigating circumstances), but only murderers should be executed.  It should be reserved for a special class of killers.

There are reasons not to have the justice system implement this, e.g. in the case of the death penalty you'll end up convicting some innocent people, and so you end up with murder on your hands, but that's a problem in practice of aplying it on a large scale. similarly it may be benefiicial to punish revenge to stop it getting out of control and because it's usually a case of he said/ she said, but you still should have the moral right to retaliate, even if you don't have the legal right to.

CMV

EDIT: a little more on how this would be taken into account by the justice system:

If i stab someone in the leg i get x punishment. If i stab someone in the eye i get y punishment. Say it's jail time for both. Personally i think eye stab is worse than leg stab, so i'll go with y&gt;x, but you may disagree. Either way we need to assign some punishment and decide which is punished worse.

I stab you in the leg, you stab me in the eye. You should get y-x jail time, since you've already been (retroactively) punished 'x worth' for the leg, and it was my fault.

If we both stab each other in the leg, the y-x = 0 since they're the same, and neither of us get punished since we're already 'even'.

I don't think any of this applies beyond those who were initially involved. You can't punish someones relatives or friends etc. because of something they did, you can only punish that person.</selfText></submission>

CMV.</title><commentCount>56</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1he2ew/i_believe_the_death_penalty_is_morally_and/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I've done quite a bit of research on the death penalty over the past few years, and every bit of it has led me to the conclusion that the death penalty is abhorrent and should be abolished as soon as possible in the US and world justice system. That doesn't mean I oppose it for people who still could pose a threat (so please don't take that approach), it means I oppose it for already apprehended individuals who have been convicted of a crime. In virtually all scenarios. There are specific exceptions that can be dreamed up, as in most scenarios, but in the *vast* majority of cases, including murder, mass murder, rape, and whatever else, I believe the death penalty should never be employed. Here's my main reasons. I can provide citations if anyone asks for them for all of these assertions, but suffice to say these reasons are not abitrary, and have been developed over quite a few years of research.

1. The death penalty is morally wrong. I could give a long speech about why, but it would essentially boil down to "two wrongs don't make a right". It's moral reasoning we teach grade schoolers, but it is thrown away entirely in this case. If no other reasons present themselves, taking a life to somehow "right a wrong" is revenge, pure and simple. It doesn't fix anything, any more than a toddler hitting someone back fixes anything.

2. The death penalty is exorbitantly expensive. It costs far more than life in prison in virtually all cases, and sometimes that difference is double, triple, or far more. Want to bring down the national debt? Abolishing the death penalty in the US would net hundreds of millions a year, and while admittedly that's not really enough to make a big difference, talk about wasteful spending. The taxpayer should not be forced to give their money to take lives, especially when less money could be given to not take that life.

3. The death penalty is inherently racist and heavily prejudiced against lower economic strata. This is true of the rest of the justice system as well, but more for the death penalty. My college-level statistics class did an analysis on black v. other death penalty convictions, and they were hugely skewed. One state even abolished the death penalty because of this discrepancy. The thing is, there is no way to appeal to prove bias because, well, the convicted is usually already dead. That means we have a system that is worse than the regular system where there are no do-overs, denying the accused the right to appeal. *DISCLAIMER: Apparently people didn't get what I meant the first time around. I apologize. Please read these for more info before posting.*

4. The death penalty does not deter other crimes. Correlation doesn't imply causation, but even if it did, death penalty proponents would be in trouble. The average murder rates in states employing the death penalty vs states that do not has been higher in *every single year* since the moratorium from the 70's ended.  There is no evidence for deterrence, and the burden of proof is quite clearly on those who say the death penalty deters crime. Taking a life when it saves none? See #1.

5. Far too many innocent people are executed with the death penalty. With no other reasons to employ the death penalty, 1 innocent person executed is too many, but it's a lot more than that. The problem is, courts don't entertain cases for innocence after someone is already dead, meaning that a total of **0** people have been officially proclaimed as executed when innocent. Speculation is all we have, but there are myriad cases where enough evidence has been established to pretty much confirm the deceased's innocence, hinting at more where no one can or no one bothered to dig up evidence after someone is already dead. What we do have is exonerations post-convictions but pre-execution, and there are plenty of those - about 5 every year. These are cases where the justice system has convicted them, and all they are doing is awaiting death, but evidence appears and they are released. Honestly, I'd be more comfortable if it was more than five a year, because so many times, evidence doesn't surface, or no one bothers post-conviction, so an innocent person dies. Again, the huge problem with this is that there is no data, just speculation from both sides, because the government doesn't recognize any innocence.

There are smaller reasons as well, but those are the main ones. I'm making this CMV because I'm becoming aware that my opinion is very locked, and confirmation bias probably has played no small role in digging this information up, though I did make an attempt to be objective. I entered my death penalty research with an open mind, formed my opinion, and have been locked in it ever since - and have only become more convinced with time. I'd especially appreciate data and links detailing research on these topics.

I don't think the death penalty is harsh enough for serious crimes like first-degree murder (especially of multiple people) and manslaughter.  If somebody is contemplating suicide, they may decide to commit a heinous crime instead with the death penalty.

I am not suggesting torture, but maybe life in solitary confinement.  Basically, if convicted of one of these heinous acts, I think they need to endure punishment where they wish they were dead instead of actually being dead.   Death to me seems like an easy way out.  

I think it may be a deterrent to commiting such crimes If there were a harsher penalty than death.  

I am by no means an expert in the area of criminal punishment (which I have probably made clear) however it maddens me that people can commit such inhumane crimes and simply get an injection that causes them death (which they probably don't mind dying anyway)

EDIT:  There were several great points made.  While it is my personal belief that serial killers and terrorists and the like may deserve ultra harsh punishment, that doesn't make it right.   And ultimately it wouldn't solve the problem.  Thanks, all</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>93</id><identifier>4grb97</identifier><title>CMV: Dexter Morgan only did two things wrong: One, he was too eager to kill without substantial evidence. Two, the code was wrongly ordered.</title><commentCount>54</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4grb97/cmv_dexter_morgan_only_did_two_things_wrong_one/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>He was a psychopath who had a constant case of blood-lust. As far as he was aware this was permanent, there was no point seeking help. Harry Morgan had extensive experience with murderers and had shown Dexter MRI's of his brain, demonstrating to him that his brain was lacking in areas that would have allowed him to empathize. So, rightly or wrongly, Dexter as an adult was sure that he (1) had an appetite for blood and needed to kill and (2) couldn't change.

From this point he only really had three options. He could have let it run rampant and kill anyone, he could have killed himself, or he could have used Harry's Code. I think we can all agree that the first option would have been the least "moral." But given the option between killing himself and killing those who supposedly deserve it (murderers, child rapists, etc.) and as a result saving innocent lives (even if that wasn't his priority), was the better choice.

As the show played out, we saw that he killed several innocent people by accident. This was due to the fact that he was too eager to kill. He killed without first gathering enough empirical evidence. In regard to the photographer, for example, he assumed that as the girls blood was in his photography studio, he must have killed her. If he had been more cautious, and waited a little longer or searched his house, then he could have found the actual murderer. Yes, even if he was more cautious then he could have still killed innocent people, but the idea of the "weight of evidence" and "reasonable doubt" are problems that we find in our own legal system. For all we know we could be putting innocent people in prison or in an electric chair every day, but we rely on those concepts because they're the best we have.

The other problem was that the first rule of the code was "don't get caught." This was why Dexter had to put Doakes in a cage. If the first rule was "never kill or harm an innocent", then this could have been mitigated. This comes to the problem of defining "innocent" but you could simply give an arbitrary answer such as "someone who is a murderer or child rapist" or "any person who could be charged with the death penalty." If he could no longer control his blood-lust while following the first rule, then he should have killed himself.

I am absolutely not advocating any kind of "vigilante justice." That should always be left to the courts. The 4th amendment is something that I hold in the highest regard, and it should never be taken for granted. But the reason that we need the 4th amendment is because the police in some cases have an incentive to lie and plant evidence. Dexter however, doesn't need to convince anyone other than himself, so attempting to lie to himself would violate the new first rule "never kill or harm an innocent." For someone who truly believed that he couldn't change and that he would have this blood-lust forever, I think that this was the most "moral" thing to do.

----

**Tl;dr: [1] Dexter as an adult was sure that he couldn't change and that he had an appetite for blood and needed to kill. [2] From here he had two realistic options: kill himself or kill those who deserved it. [3] If he had enforced a higher standard in regard to gathering evidence, then there would have been much less of a chance of killing an innocent by accident. Punishing an innocent person for a crime they did not commit is truly horrible, but "reasonable doubt" and weight of evidence are things that we use to convict people in our own legal system as well. [4] If the first rule of the code was changed to "never kill or harm an innocent", then this would have further reduced his chances of killing innocent people in order to protect himself. [5] For someone who truly believed that he couldn't change and that he would have this blood-lust forever, I think that this was the most "moral" thing to do.**

[n] refers to nth paragraph

**I imagine that those who disagree will argue that he could kill more innocent people than he saves, which is a fair point. But if that is your line of argument, then do you think that it *would* be the most "moral" thing to do if he could be 100% sure that he would save more innocent lives than he took?**

**EDIT**: I just want to say this very clearly: *I* am absolutely not saying that he couldn't have changed, rather I believe that he could have learned of a way to control his urges. What I am saying is that he was taught that he couldn't change from the time that he was a kid, so it's reasonable to assume that *he* would have truly believed that he couldn't. I am talking about the most moral thing to do from his point of view.

Yet I don't see why.

The most fundamental argument is that murder and killing is fundamentally wrong, and that it should be prevented as much as possible. However, locking people up and depriving them of their freedom is also wrong, and it is done in prison anyway. The justice system of country needs to apply penalties which would be immoral in any other circumstances, precisely because that's how it gets it's ability to punish.
I believe the core objective of a judicial system is to protect the people, and prevent crime. Of course, criminals are part of the people who need to be protected, and this is why prisons should not be horrible places, but instead places which help criminals get over the reasons which made them commit crimes, and helps them go back to society. However, if a person is clearly unwilling to and incapable of being a part of society, and if that person is dangerous to society, then shouldn't that person be removed from the world?
You might argue that killing is a lot more horrible than prison, but is that really so? Being locked up for the rest of your life is pretty horrible too, and some might argue it is worst. In the case of serial killers, it has to be one of the two, so there is no way of not being harsh about this.
I agree that the death penalty poses a lot of practical problems, such as the fact that it is irreversible (which sucks if you later find out the person was innocent), and as far as I know it doesn't reduce crime much. I don't think it should ever be used on anyone who could reintegrate society if given the chance. But I don't see any reason to call it a violation of human rights.

However, I still feel like the death penalty is wrong. I therefore ask you : change my view.

CMV.</title><commentCount>53</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1t657y/i_believe_that_life_in_prison_without_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Whenever debating over the death penalty this viewpoint never seems to be brought up,  usually everyone assumes the death penalty to be the worst punishment possible.  I however think that life in prison without the possibility of parole is worse.  

Why I think this:

● Prison is a pretty bad place to be.  I've never heard anyone say they liked prison and most well tell you how awful it is.  The legal system is based on the idea that a longer prison sentence means a worse punishment,  thus a life sentence is worse than anything less. 

●If you get life in prison you're going to die in prison, which has the same end result as the death penalty. 

●The death penalty is a painless way to be killed (I realize 
there are reports that it is painful but it's claimed to be painless so for simplicity lets assume it is painless) where as many natural deaths may not be painless. 

Ultimately it seems like the death penalty is a way to get a shorter prison sentence and guarantee a painless death, thus making it a less harsh sentence than life in prison.  CMV.</selfText></submission>

This is an absurd waste of resources.  For one, depending on the age of the criminal, the state is going to be keeping him/her alive in prison for at least 10 years and in some cases upwards of 50.  For another, this is giving them the opportunity to break out and cause more havoc than they already have.  I'm grossly overestimating prison escape statistics but the fact of the matter is that if they break out more and more people will be hurt because of their actions.  There is, from my perspective, no reason to let a person who has a life sentence in jail to live, as it only wastes money, prison space, and the time of everyone involved.  Change my view.

I believe prison should be used to rehabilitate individuals so that they may return to society. I don't understand why locking someone up for life is beneficial to anyone. Let's say someone steals your car. I think they should be given a jail sentence that would provide enough time for that person to recognize what they did is wrong and hopefully be able to come out of jail as a better person. (I also think we would need better ways of releasing individuals into the public. Lots of people dont have the means to come out of jail and stabilize their life.) 

If someone does a crime so atrocious that society deems them unable to return from it, then I believe the death penalty is justified. I don't agree that people should be locked up until they die. 1) It doesn't help them. 2) It's really expensive.

<submission><id>98</id><identifier>2dwpux</identifier><title>CMV: We should prohibit some people from possessing or consuming alcohol like we do with firearms</title><commentCount>54</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2dwpux/cmv_we_should_prohibit_some_people_from/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Note: This is related to United States law, but in theory it could apply to other places. I am specifically arguing this from a perspective of US law.

There are various things that disqualify people from being allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. These generally include (sometimes depending on state) being involuntarily committed to a mental institution, being the target of a restraining order, being adjudicated by a court to be mentally unfit to stand trial, being convicted of a violent misdemeanor or a domestic violence crime, and being convicted of a felony.

Most people seem to be perfectly happy with prohibiting some people from possessing firearms based on their history, convictions, mental illness, etc. I believe we should be very careful with who we remove constitutionally protected rights from, but I am ok with removing firearm rights through due process of law in most of the cases where we do under current law.

My question is why do we not remove the privilege of people to possess and consume alcohol under certain circumstances? This isn't a constitutionally protected right, and removal of that freedom would be done with due process anyway, so there is no particular reason why we cannot do it.

We should create a list of offenses that disqualify a person from being allowed to possess or consume alcohol. That list should include people with a DUI conviction that resulted in injury or death to an innocent person, with a felony DUI conviction (multiple DUIs in a short period, DUI while on a suspended license, etc), people with a domestic violence or child endangerment conviction that was alcohol related, and perhaps even people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution with suicidal tendencies.

Alcohol consumption seems to increase risk of suicide in people who are already very depressed or suicidal, it seems to increase the likelihood of domestic violence and child abuse, and it definitely increases the risk of DUI in people with prior DUI convictions.

In fact, I have a friend with 4 DUIs over a period of less than 10 years, 1 while driving on a suspended license, and yet they still eventually gave him his license back, and he still drinks regularly and sometimes drives while under the influence. I think that is appalling, just because he hasn't hurt anyone yet doesn't mean he should be allowed to keep drinking and driving until someone gets killed. His ability to legally possess and consume alcohol is a danger to society, and simply suspending his license again isn't good enough, he will still drive illegally even without a license.
Here is how I would implement it. I think it is too much of a burden to require all bars and liquor stores to call up a system and run a background check on every patron like the current NICS system for firearms. Instead, I propose that people who are deemed to be prohibited persons should have a special mark placed on their driver's license or ID which would indicate that they are prohibited. Bar tenders and liquor store employees would need to check everyone's ID, not just people who appear to be under age, and would be required to refuse to sell alcohol to anyone with that mark on their license.

Obviously that won't stop them from paying a homeless person to buy them alcohol, like teenagers do, so we also need strict penalties for prohibited persons who are caught with any alcohol in their blood or in their possession, and even stricter penalties if they are caught committing any sort of crime while under the influence such as DUI, domestic violence, etc.

This post was prompted by this thread, but has also been something I've been thinking about for a long time:http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2dnxcy/should_the_government_be_allowed_to_ban_people/

TL;DR: Just like some people are deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess firearms due to criminal activity or mental illness, some people (potentially for different reasons) should be deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess or consume alcohol, and it should be a criminal offense for a prohibited person to possess or consume alcohol.
