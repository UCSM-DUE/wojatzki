It's not something that I like, but unfortunately after much thought I've discovered that what they say is mostly true. Perhaps it shouldn't be relevant but I am a woman and initially had the same reaction to TRP as everyone else. I thought they were just a bunch of men that hated women. Even though this might be partially true, I don't think this invalidates what they say. It is very upsetting to me that someone that hates me would be right, but that doesn't make what they say not true. Here is a list of things I think they are right about.   

*  We live in a very gynocentric society that is sexist against men. To give a few examples, men get longer prison sentences, are convicted at higher rates for the same crimes, and receive longer sentences for killing women than for killing men. (i.e. men are disposable)  

*  We always assume men to be the aggressor in any encounter. Women actually commit more domestic violence than men, yet we always assume it's the man who is abusive. Another example, "My husband tells me what I should wear" Sounds bad right? How about "My wife tells me what I should wear." The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power, but we don't assume the same for women.   

*  Men have to be extraordinarily careful not to sound like they are blaming women whenever they vent any sort of frustration or emotion. For instance, "Why do women like that asshole and not me?" is something that you might find mocked in /r/niceguys or /r/justneckbeardthings. Yet if a woman says something like "Why does that guy like the hot girl but not me?" she would be most likely receive sympathy. Men have to be super careful in choosing their words, which is ironic because we encourage men to express their emotions more. Yet when they do, we shame them for it.   

* Male sexuality is considered shameful. Men are considered creepy if they have a blow up doll, for an example. Yet it's perfectly normal for a woman to have a collection of dildos. Men are shamed if they date much younger women, even if she is a  consenting adult.  

* Perhaps this isn't too controversial, but women are attracted to status, masculinity, power, and good looks. They are more attracted to a man if other women want him. They are no less superficial in their sexual preferences than men. Weakness is unattractive to women. Being an emotional, sensitive man is a death sentence in the dating world.  

* RPillers have a right to be angry and upset because men are almost always blamed for everything. They are assumed to be the bad guy. TRP is the one place that they can get relief from this and where women can be the bad guy for once.  I also feel like all women are partially responsible for their state. We should have been the ones to stand up and defend men. Men have a hard time  standing up for themselves without being perceived as weak or misogynist.   

* The more power the man has in the relationship, [the longer the relationship lasts](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01544589) and the more power the woman has, [the unhappier the relationship.](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/93/3/513/)  

I don't agree with all of RP views, and I hate that they are correct about these things, but I believe they are more right than the current mainstream narrative. Part of me wonders if I am just suffering from Stockholm syndrome, because I spend a lot of time reading their subreddit. CMV.

I mean consider that historically leaving Islam was (and still is in some parts) a death sentence , isn't that different to their disconnection policy, the space opera is as crazy as the Buraq tale (the flying horse) or the transparent virgins in Muslim heaven.

The idea of engrams messing with humanity is no more silly than the idea of the holy spirit or the Devil influencing humanity.  The idea of Jesus resurrecting is as daft as the idea of clear souls etc. 

Confession is when you give your secrets ("sins") to a priest to be forgiven, add some rudimentary galvanic skin response stuff and wham you have auditing 

Practices like Disconnection displayed by groups like Jehovah's Witnesses is very similar to the Scientology practice of it. The Sea Org isn't a world away from Mormon Missionary work

Then you have the founders, both LRon and Joesph Smith were conmen, the first pope wanted Christianity as a power tool same goes for Muhammed 

If Scientology survives for 1300 years I bet it would be seen the same as mainstream religion today

<submission><id>2</id><identifier>28l9bo</identifier><title>CMV: Arresting an 89 year old former Auschwitz guard is wrong.</title><commentCount>506</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/28l9bo/cmv_arresting_an_89_year_old_former_auschwitz/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>On Tuesday, 89 year old Johann Breyer was arrested in Philadelphia for a German warrant citing over 100 counts of murder. He admitted to being an armed guard at Auschwitz, and allegedly he was also a volunteer and member of the SS. Each count is linked to a trainload of victims brought to the death camp while he worked there.

I do not know whether this particular man is guilty, nor his current political beliefs. However I maintain that even if he has been a Nazi sympathizer his whole life, even if he has no regrets about his past, and even if he was a willing participant in all those murders, he should not be arrested for this crime.

The man in question was 20 years old when Auschwitz was liberated, and only 19 at the time of the crimes cited by the German warrant. He had volunteered at the age of 17. I'm sure no one here was complicit in genocide at that age, but nonetheless we all made mistakes when we were younger. The difference is Breyer lived in a time when the potential impact of youthful mistakes was much greater. The Nazi regime deliberately appropriated the folly of youth for its own means, and even the most ideological 20 year olds were simply pawns in the Holocaust.

Statutes of limitations are generally accepted as an important element of modern justice. While there may not be a legal limit when it comes to crimes like murder, I believe there should be. I don't know what the cutoff point should be, but surely 70 years is too much. 70 years ago is history, and as any historian will tell you [we cannot judge the actions and beliefs of remote historical periods based on modern standards.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)) Maybe we can judge political leaders, but not everyday citizens.

The fact is death camps were legal in Nazi Germany. The actions committed there were legally sanctioned violence. There are plenty of examples of otherwise criminal actions legally permitted in modern society. For example, what if 20 years from now we decided to prosecute anyone who contributed to global warming? We might be justified in blaming political leaders who set policies that allowed corporations to pollute, and we might even be justified in blaming corporate executives who destroyed our environment for their own gain, but could we prosecute a factory worker?

Breyer was 9 years old when Hitler came to power. He was 14 when WWII officially began. It is simply impossible to judge someone raised in that environment using modern liberal democratic standards. The Nazi regime was designed to brainwash children into total loyalty and enthusiastic support for its evil ideals. Maybe we can judge people who were older and wiser, but a child raised in the Third Reich deserves leniency.

The most important question in my mind is: what does anyone gain by prosecuting Johann Breyer? Yes some of his victims are still alive, and of course it is difficult to assign any benefit to a murder trial since the real victims cannot receive any recompense for their suffering. However, a death sentence would be excessive and life in prison relatively meaningless for such an old man. It seems obvious that the real function of a trial like this is to reduce German society's guilt to a single individual and punish him in order to lighten its own conscience. Breyer was not a politician or other public figure, he was a worker. The only reason to target Breyer is because he coincidentally is one of the last Nazi criminals left alive - if Hitler was still alive to be prosecuted, Breyer would never have been arrested.

I personally believe in modern German collective guilt. It is healthy for a whole country to recognize and regret its past, regardless of whether individuals were participants or even alive at the time. In the same way, English people have to atone for 19th century colonialism and Americans should express remorse for the genocide of Native Americans (in fact this has not been emphasized enough, but that's a discussion for another time). However, these are historical facts for which no single individual can be held to account. If a living individual could be blamed, it would only detract from the necessary collective guilt. Society needs to learn from its mistakes, not externalize its guilt onto a single person.

Was Breyer "only following orders" as many Nazis claimed? Even if he was following orders, does that make his crimes any less? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I believe that they are questions for historians and philosophers rather than lawyers and judges.

*TLDR:* Regardless of his actual guilt, Auschwitz guard Johann Breyer should not have been arrested because:
* He was the product of an evil society that brainwashed his generation
* At the time of his crimes he was barely old enough to be considered a legal adult, and minors are less culpable than adults
* All crimes should have a statute of limitations
* His crimes should be judged in a different historical context, because they were part of a different society
* His prosecution is only a way for modern society to feel better about itself by punishing an arbitrary individual

CMV.</title><commentCount>352</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1ihnzp/i_believe_maleficent_from_sleeping_beauty_is_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Let's do a lighthearted CMV shall we? 

First, Maleficent has the coolest costume. She has like devilish horns on her head and a huge cape. 

Maleficent pretty much sentences a baby to death because she was not invited to a party. 

She can disappear in a cloud of green smoke.

She has a really fucking cool staff.

She kills beautiful flowers with her frost

She has a pet Raven.

She lives in, what looks like, the Goblin King's castle.

Her minions are pretty ugly.

She taunts the prince after she captures him. That is pretty fucked up. 

And lastly, She turns into a fucking Dragon! 

You can try to CMV, but the fact she turns into a Dragon kind of makes her unbeatable. However, I am curious, and think CMV can use a lighthearted post. 

**EDIT: So, yeah, this was a fun time. I am really happy with this thread, and am stoked everyone got into. It was nice having a fun argument on something everyone loves and knows amongst all this seriousness happening in this sub lately. Also, almost no one was an asshole, which is always refreshing. I think the best argument for best villain I heard against Maleficent was Scar. Maleficent is still my favorite, but everyone made great points, and I think we can all agree; Most Disney villains are FUCKING terrifying.** </selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>4</id><identifier>3ddcu5</identifier><title>CMV: America is already a police state, the public just hasn't admitted it yet.</title><commentCount>264</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3ddcu5/cmv_america_is_already_a_police_state_the_public/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.

Edit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.

First Amendment

Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.

[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.

Second Amendment

Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.

Fourth Amendment

Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.

[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.

[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.

It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.

Fifth Amendment

Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).

[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.

Sixth Amendment

You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.

[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.

Eighth Amendment

Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.

I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.

[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.

[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.

Bottom line:

You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.

Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.

It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?

Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.

If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.

I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.

<submission><id>5</id><identifier>21ow74</identifier><title>CMV: I believe that men's issues are more important than women's issues in American society.</title><commentCount>242</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/21ow74/cmv_i_believe_that_mens_issues_are_more_important/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>The main reasons that I believe this are because men's issues are often a matter of life and death, and men's issues do not have any acceptance or recognition in modern culture.

**Men's issues are a matter of life and death.**

I'd like to focus on four main issues here: combat deaths, workplace injury/death, suicide/depression, and violent crime. 

Recent statistics for the war in Iraq show that 97.5% of combat deaths are male and 2.5% are female. [Source](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22452.pdf) In the past, it is likely that these statistics were almost 100% male. While it is hopeful that the draft (in the USA at least) will not be reinstated, men are the only ones required to register for Selective Service. Why is this not denigrated as sexist? Throughout history men have either been forced into military service or shamed when they did not serve. Look up the “White Feather Women”. It's easy to be self-righteous when you have no danger of being called up to serve. 

In 2011, 4308 males died in the workplace compared to 385 females. [Source](http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0010.pdf) This comes out to 92% male and 8% female workplace deaths. Should we not be asking questions about why there is such a huge gender disparity? If it is because more men choose these type of dangerous jobs (which is likely), then shouldn't we be asking why men choose (or possibly are forced to choose) these types of jobs? It seems to me that there are societal factors that influence men to choose a dangerous career (or to be in the military) just as there are societal factors that influence women to be less likely to choose engineering/science majors. While I agree that we should work on improving both of these inequalities, this is an issue of life and death for men, and yet it gets no publicity at all.

Men have high rates of suicide and depression that are not being addressed. Men are four times more likely to die from suicide than women. [Source](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml) Why do men choose to commit suicide using more violent methods than women? The statistics I found suggest that women have higher rates of depression than men, although personally I think they are close to 50/50 due to underreporting of male depression. In any case, there is a stigma in society against men expressing their feelings or getting help for their depression. Men are expected to “man up” or “get over it” and just deal with their problems rather than getting the help they deserve. In my opinion, this leads to the higher rate of successful suicides among men.

Men are more likely to be a victim of a violent crime ([Source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf)). Despite all the publicity about women being scared to walk around at night, men are still much more likely to be assaulted or mugged than women. 

I think the gender inequality in these areas stems from historical views that men were largely expendable, and that attitude continues to this day. In contrast, women were and are protected (“women and children first!”). I obviously agree that there are harmful stereotypes about women that are commonly accepted, such as not being respected in business, but I'd take that stereotype any day over being expendable and much more prone to death. 

**Men's issues have no acceptance or recognition in modern culture.**

Here are just some examples of issues that men uniquely face in our society:

* Men receive prison sentences almost 3 times longer than women committing the same crime. [Source](http://www.terry.uga.edu/~mustard/sentencing.pdf) In fact, the gender gap is 6 times higher than racial disparity ([Source](http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx)) for sentencing. Think about how racist American courts are, now imagine how much more sexist than that they actually are.

* Male genital mutilation is a common and accepted practice in First World countries, while female genital mutilation is abhorred and only happens in Third World countries. Oh, sure, male genital mutilation is “not as bad” as female genital mutilation. Therefore we shouldn't care about it at all?

* Men are told from (some) feminist groups that it is not possible for a man to be raped. The CDC definition of rape does not even include “being forced to penetrate”, which is the primary way that women rape men. I'm not even going to cite statistics about which gender is raped more because it doesn't even matter. All of these people, male or female, are victims and should be given support and encouragement, and their rapists should be brought to justice. But male rape is not taken seriously by most people. Raped men are often made fun of or called “faggots,” or they are told that they actually wanted it all along, because all men care about is sex, right? I'm sure you saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko). Actor or not, this is what raped men, and I should know, feel like in today's society. 

Compare all of the issues I've talked about (and there are many, many more) to those affecting women. I found a list of these women's issues on /r/feminism.

* bodily integrity and autonomy
* fair wages and equal career opportunities
* the right to vote and the representation of women in politics
* the right to own property
* the right to education

Three of those: the right to own property, the right to education, and the right to vote don't even apply to Western society any more. And in the past, they didn't even apply to most men either, since you had to be a wealthy landowner to be educated or vote. Most people in the past got screwed over no matter what gender you were, and it bothers me that people act like the past was so great for men and so terrible for women. It sucked for 95% of people regardless of gender.

I agree that bodily integrity and autonomy is important, but in America at least we have available abortions and birth control. In fact, there are plenty of women's groups that provide free or cheap versions of those. Women have plenty of reproductive choices, men have few or none. Birth control pills for men do not exist (yet). Men do not have a choice in whether their child will be aborted or not. When faced with a pregnancy, women can choose whether or not to be mothers, but men cannot choose whether or not to be fathers. This is another issue that I think is more important for men than women, and yet men's issues in this area are never discussed. 

Fair wages are important, but we have laws in this country that ensure that women are paid equal salary to men for equal work. You can argue that sometimes these laws are broken, but then that's an enforcement issue. Again, even in the worst case scenario that women are paid less than men, consider that men are overwhelmingly represented in dangerous careers. Wouldn't it be better to be paid less and *stay alive* than to be dead? Representation in politics I'll also give you, but consider that more women vote in elections than men. [Source](http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/voters/documents/genderdiff.pdf). Women clearly are voting these men into office in high numbers. If you want more women in politics, vote for them.

I am not trying to say that women's issues are not important, because they obviously are, but in my mind all of these issues are less important than the men's issues I mentioned. Furthermore, women's issues receive funding and attention, while men's issues are largely denigrated and ignored. Have you ever heard of a domestic violence shelter for men? Have you ever heard of birth control for men? (I'll give you a hint, it's [out there](http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/index.php/article/2012/02/male_birth_control_pill_levels_the_field_male_birth_control_pill_levels_the_field), just not receiving hardly any support or acknowledgement). Have you ever heard discussions about why men die on average 8 years earlier than women? Shouldn't we be addressing that huge gender disparity or at least discussing it productively?

I appreciate all viewpoints here. I know that my belief that men's issues are more important than women's issues is an extremely controversial idea, and I'm trying to find some middle ground here. Please give me some reasons to find this middle ground, because I've been trying to find it for weeks now and I can't see any reason why women's issues are in any way comparable in severity to men's issues. I honestly want my view changed (in fact, I would be very happy if I could be convinced that men's and women's issues are *equal* in severity), I just can't find any way to do it.

EDIT: It seems like I'm getting a lot more downvotes than a typical CMV post. I hate people who complain about downvotes, but if you disagree with me, please don't downvote this post. It only means that I'm less likely to hear the reply that might convince me to change my view. I am genuinely interested in everything that people have to say, so please respond to this post and tell me in words not votes.

EDIT 2: Overall, I'm just... disappointed. I feel much more attacked than reasoned with. Although some of you have been very polite and reasonable, I'd say a large portion of the responses have been veiled attacks. I expected better from this subreddit. Lots of deleted comments and PMs telling me I'm scum. The most common answer I received was that these are "human" issues, not men's issues. This is not the way that "female" issues like rape are treated in our society. I dare you to tell a feminist that rape isn't a woman's issue. Why do issues that disproportionally affect men suddenly get treated differently? The whole thread is just bogged down in petty little arguments on particular issues, and I'm tired of it. I want you to address the entire thrust of my argument, not just pick a tiny little battle you think you can win. 

I'm going to keep reading responses and reply when I can. Please keep responding to me. I'm willing to listen.

<submission><id>6</id><identifier>1f9bqn</identifier><title>I think that many of the major pro-gun arguments are fallacious. CMV.</title><commentCount>174</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1f9bqn/i_think_that_many_of_the_major_progun_arguments/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Yes, this is related to some of the arguments posted in the recent gun CMV. 

Point of clarification: I am almost always talking about semiautomatic and automatic weapons, and all handguns. Your 4ft long hunting rifle, bolt-action, still hunts/protects but isn't committing any crazy sprees and isn't sneaking up on someone. My view is currently most like "Ban all firearms under 1m in length, and all those that are automatic or semiautomatic in nature". However, that's not really the point of this CMV. So, the points - 

Here are a few that come to mind right now:

1) "Why make them illegal when criminals will get them anyway"?
Why doesn't this exact same argument apply to:  
- Breaking and entering  
- Murder  
- Theft  
- Any patently antisocial activity  
I think that criminalizing all of those activities increase the barrier to entry, and decreases total participants, and decreasing participants in gun-wielding will reduce incidental, "crime of passion", and other non-violent-crime deaths. **EDIT: I happen to think that it probably will reduce violent crime, but we'd need to test it here, in the US, to see. I'm willing to ignore that and cede, in my mind, the "worst case scenario" that it does not reduce violent crime.**


2) "Giving X a gun lets them defend themself in case Y"  
I fail to see how knowledge of the defender owning a gun -- even having one on them -- doesn't just make the attacker add the sentence "move toward your gun and I shoot" and become and equivalent case to non-gun-ownership. An attacker, virtually by definition, will already be in a threatening, wielding, posture in and in a position of power to dictate terms of the interaction. They should always be able to pre-empt a situation like this. Why isn't this true? If you assume that the attacker does not possess a firearm, what makes that a reasonable assumption, especially given that some of the most pro-gun advocates advocate enforced carry? **EDIT: I forgot to ask about the comparison to non-lethal options. Stun guns, tasers, etc for people; bear mace, etc., for aggressive wild animals**

3)  "If people can't legally get guns and criminals illegally have it, there is still violent crime X!"  
Strawman! No one debates that. The point is that incidental deaths by legal firearms will be absent. It seems like every time the debate comes up, you hear "getting rid of legal guns won't stop robbery at gunpoint!" or something similar (rape/gang incidents/etc). Am I wrong in feeling that this strawman is frequently set up? Or is there a reason that I shouldn't consider this a strawman?

4) "X kills more people annually than guns".  
I have never seen an "X" that is not done VASTLY MORE than wielding a gun with safety off (eg, active use), when the accurate comparison would be deaths/(active use interval):deaths/(active use interval). I have *never* met anyone or even heard of any case where someone spends comparable time with a loaded, ready, gun ready compared to sitting in a car; yet, comparing gun deaths to automobile deaths always seems to come up. Why is this (very) common argument valid in the slightest? It really feels like comparing apples and chickens.  **EDIT: It was mentioned this is a worst-case. I would argue it isn't. Talking about the gun in a holster, or with the safety on, or in a drawer, is like talking about parked cars killing people, or people drowning in empty swimming pools, or death by alcohol in a sealed bottle before any has been taken (I hope everyone would agree that's absurd). *It isn't being used*. Hope that helps**

**EDIT:  
5) "Guns are there to keep the government in check".  
Really? Any amount of armament you have is going to keep an M1 Abrams at bay? An F22? A SWAT team? A CIA sniper? Please. If anyone really does believe that their personal firearm ownage -- and those of people they know -- are going to do a single thing against government military, paramilitary, or special ops forces, oh boy please justify that. I mean, our populace isn't filled with Jason Bournes, James Bonds, etc.; that idea seems to me to be wishful thinking to live in an action movie as the hero. I thought that that was obvious but there was a comment on it.**

I will try very hard to not respond to the comments in the thread proper to mitigate thread degeneration (SIWOTI syndrome), and update this as applicable. Please respond to one or all points here. A bit of a weird CMV but there you have it.  **EDIT: A few clarifications. Thanks for the reasoned discussion so far.**</selfText></submission>

It is my contention that the property destruction and disruption of commerce in Ferguson are the only reasons that this issue gained international attention.  We have a democracy that acts almost exclusively in the interests of a small handful of corporate elites and government officials, which causes actual human suffering to be on the back burner.  Other avenues for political redress such as voting and even peaceful protesting by itself (which are ultimately more effective in the end, but typically only after having a flash point or event to rally around) have been largely compromised by corporate interests and strategic incapacitation policing techniques.  There are racially tinged police murders under far less ambiguous circumstances wherein the behavior of the officers is much more difficult to justify that never gained as much traction when protesters hold exclusively peaceful demonstrations, and it underlies our society's perpetual valuing of windows and business over actual human lives.  Moreover, high profile riots make white middle America (which controls the political arena) evaluate the issue.  When White America is afraid that traffic will be blocked, or that their business might be burned/looted, or that a brick might come flying through their living room window, this forces the issue into the public consciousness and varying solutions must be considered.  

Many say that the property destruction opened the issue to easy critiques since many are beholden to heavily indoctrinated notions of bourgeois morality (the old two wrongs don't make a right adage, even when one wrong is a death and the other is property being destroyed/stolen), and while this is true it gave people a cause to rally around.  White America and the media are masterful at rationalizing and ignoring systemic racism and police brutality, and while the #blacklivesmatter is obvious propaganda it has kept the discussion of racist policing in the public discourse since it did grow organically after a high profile police shooting.  The rioters took action which has a strong psychological impact on those for whom the issue resonates.  Taking action (even a less than ideal one) has much weight than people claiming to "support" a cause without actually giving anything of themselves to it.

The tactic of rallying around a murder to highlight racist inequity has been employed since the Classic Civil Rights Era (see the murder of Emmett Till), and people arguing over whether or not the particular murder in question was less than ideal miss the point entirely.  People are talking about the murder, and (even if for a brief second) the issues that sparked the outrage though this more important narrative is tightly controlled by a media apparatus hellbent on fixating on the explosion than the planting and lighting of the bomb that caused it.  Had it been a perfect situation with the cops saying "nigger" before shooting a completely sympathetic victim and even if it was video recorded by a very credible witness, the discussion would have easily devolved into "this particular cop was just a bad egg," and the protests got what they wanted when he was fired/convicted.  

Because of the ambiguity in the Ferguson shooting, the stark contrasts in *perceptions* among blacks and whites becomes a primary issue of contention.  It's not about bad cops getting out of hand on occasion, but about why so many black people have the idea that the cops treat them unfairly or with undue violence.   No one would have even been talking about that had the case been less focused on contradictory narratives, and it would have never even made international news if the police hadn't responded in a militarized fashion to the peaceful protests that were mobilized after the initial riots.  This uproar was never about police militarization or even bad egg cops.  It is about public policies that have created racist law enforcement practices that marginalize and inflame the black community. Not many have said it that articulately, but it's bubbling underneath the surface of the "national discussion" on Ferguson.  In an ideal democracy, third party property destruction would perhaps not be a valid form of political voicing, but as blacks are particularly disenfranchised politically and economically in the US, so using militant tactics to express rage at the societal failings I mentioned above are not only inevitably, but necessary.  

EDIT:  I've already responded to a couple of people strawmanning about how the media was mobilized before the rioting after the verdict.  This post is about the first wave of riots that made the issue a sensation in the first place.

Ideally this process should be conducted via polygraph, even though it is not 100% accurate.  People could apply for a re-test.

For example:

[62%](http://www.webcitation.org/5xkMGAEvY) of British Muslims do not believe in the protection of free speech; Only 3% adopt a "consistently pro-freedom of speech line."

[62%](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/01/strong-support-for-shariah-in-canada) of Muslims in Canada support Islamic law.

According to an interpretation of this study, approximately [45%](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) of Sharia supporters surveyed worldwide disagreed with the idea that Islamic law should apply only to Muslims.

A [survey](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/12/12/muslim-women-win) of Muslim women in Paris suburbs found that three-quarters of them wear their masks out of fear - including fear of violence.

[65%](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4092/europe-islamic-fundamentalism) of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in.

[Large majorities](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) of Muslims favor Sharia.  Among those who do, stoning women for adultery is favored by 89% in Pakistanis, 85% in Afghanistan, 81% in Egypt, 67% in Jordan, ~50% in 'moderate' Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, 58% in Iraq, 44% in Tunisia, 29% in Turkey, and 26% in Russia.

Those favoring the death penalty for [apostasy](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) (leaving the Islamic religion) include 86% in Egypt, 82% in Jordan, 42% in Iraq, 76% in Pakistan, 62% in Malaysia, 18% in moderate Indonesia, and more.

[1 in 3](http://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/survey-on-islam-in-austria-18-of-muslims-support-death-sentence-for-apostasy-21-9-oppose-democracy/) Muslims in Austria say it is not possible to be a European and a Muslim.  22% oppose democracy.

[1 in 3](http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/ShariaLawOrOneLawForAll.pdf) Muslims in the UK strongly agree that a wife should be forced to obey her husband's bidding.

[43%](http://rt.com/news/208387-austria-islam-kindergarten-muslim/) of Islamic teachers in Austria openly advocate Sharia law over democracy.

[Honor killing](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) the woman for sex outside of marriage is favored over honor killing the man in almost every Islamic country.  Over half of Muslims surveyed believed that honor killings over sex were at least partially justified.

America and the West pride themselves on how free we are compared to other nations, but we don't seem very concerned that we may be largely expanding populations who disagree with fundamental human rights.  These numbers are indicative of a failed system of immigration and assimilation.

There's more to radical Islam than simply the threat of terrorism.  There absolutely is a clash of civilizations, and we have to come to terms with that and try to encourage secularization worldwide and especially at home more than ever today.</selfText></submission>

Cmv</title><commentCount>163</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1klwr1/i_believe_no_crime_deserves_the_death_penalty_cmv/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>To make things clear due to several people not just one. I have changed my mind. In the case where their is reasonable doubt that this person will kill again the death penalty is acceptable.

The main reasons I do not believe in the death penalty are as follows.

Mistakes can be made regarding who is guilty. No matter how certain the evidence there is a chance that the person is still innocent.

Who has the right to decide that this person must die.

Execution does nothing but make people feel better, at the ultimate expense of someone else.

Does someone deserve to die if they feel true and ultimate remorse?

We can not accurately decipher the insane people from the sane.

A death penalty trial costs on average of two million dollars around the same as a 40 year prison stay.

The people who sentence people to death don't carry out the act themselves. it is easy to say this person deserves to die, but how many of them would be willing to inject someone.

A death sentence doesn't just affect the person receive but the family, friends and community of the the condemned person.

The reasons for the crime will never be fully understood by the jury, they can not decipher fact from fiction or understand the mind of the criminal.

Many people are put to death for crimes with a virtually 0% chance to re offend. (A political crime or treason.)

Opinions can be warped from media propaganda, and the prosecutor.

<submission><id>10</id><identifier>3w4yy0</identifier><title>CMV: Committing a cruel or abusive act against an animal should carry the same penalty as committing that act against another human</title><commentCount>150</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3w4yy0/cmv_committing_a_cruel_or_abusive_act_against_an/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Currently, acts of abuse against animals are typically punished with a much less sever sentence than acts of abuse against humans.  I don't believe that this is morally acceptable.  For example, if I were to put a human baby in the oven and cook it to death and I were convicted for this crime, I would almost certainly face at least 25 years in prison, but much more likely I would face life or the death sentence.  If I were to commit the exact same act, but put a puppy in the oven instead, I would probably get a fine for a few thousand dollars, maybe some community service, and in the most extreme case I might face a year in prison or so.  I've never heard of anyone getting more than 5 years in prison for animal abuse.

This seems deeply unjust to me.  Whether the creature being tortured is a human or a dog, both would experience incredible pain and trauma.  Both are innocent victims, and both have the potential to contribute to society.  An argument I often hear in response to this is that humans have much more potential to contribute to society.  However, this does not change my view, because humans also have much more potential to make negative contributions to society (humans can grow up to become terrorists; dogs can't, for example).  Therefore, it is unfair to assume that the human will contribute to society more than the dog would.

Another argument that I often hear is that animals are not as intelligent as humans, therefore their lives are less important.  I believe that this belief is due to a bias in humans towards themselves.  We are the most intelligent animals on the planet; that makes it awfully convenient that we decided intelligence is the metric to base a life's worth on.  It's like the tallest person in the room claiming that "Tall people's lives are most important", or the oldest in the room claiming "Old people's lives are most important".  We are the most intelligent species on the planet, claiming "Intelligent creatures are most important".

Finally, another argument I often hear has to do with the factory farming industry.  I eat meat (I won't deny it).  However, I feel that there is a huge difference because of the necessity.  If you inflict pain on a creature for no reason whatsoever, that is very different from killing it for food.  Also, I hold the farming industry to the same standards I hold people to.  If a farm is causing unnecessary pain to an animal, then I believe it should be treated the same as a human causing unnecessary pain.  However, I do not condemn a farm that treats their animals humanely, and makes their deaths as quick and painless as possible.

I'm interested in hearing other thoughts on this.  CMV!

In order for this to happen, the jury must vote (normally unanimously) in favor of execution after first voting that the defendant is guilty.

Many US citizens believe that executions should be banned, and would never vote in favor of executing a defendant if they were on a jury in a capital case. Because of this, such candidates are generally excluded from being on the jury in a trial for a capital offense.

My view is that this is a problem because it creates a selection bias among juries. I believe that there is a correlation between people who support death sentencing and people who are predisposed against people accused of crimes. I'm not claiming that death sentence supporters on juries don't consider the evidence and reach a sincere conclusion. But in my experience, people have different expectations when it comes to the burden of proof and aggravating and mitigating circumstances. And I believe that people who favor executing convicts are also more inclined to vote guilty given the same evidence compared to the average juror, and are more likely to feel that a crime meets the conditions that make a defendant eligible for execution compared to the average juror.

I believe that the aggregate bias introduced in this way will be strong because only about half of the population believes in the death sentence, so half of all jurors will be turned away - overall, the half that is statistically more likely to vote not guilty given the same evidence.

The ideal jury would not have this statistical bias. Obviously, if jurors who were completely opposed to executions were allowed to participate in sentencing, they would probably never vote in favor of it, so I don't have a solution (other than banning executions). Maybe there could be two sets of jurors, and those who would be excluded based on their objection to executions would still vote on whether to convict, but that is imperfect because death sentence supporters would still be the only ones evaluating the mitigating and aggravating factors, and because those who object to death sentencing might potentially vote against convicting someone they think is guilty if they know it will allow others to sentence the defendant to execution.

I found [one article](http://abolishdeathpenalty.org/jury-selection-in-capital-cases-less-than-fair/) that discusses the bias I describe here.

In order to change my view, I expect you would probably need evidence that jurors who support death sentencing are not statistically more likely to vote guilty compared to the average juror. Yes, I am placing the burden of proof on you instead of myself. If no such evidence exists, I think a study should be done.</selfText></submission>

You are sentenced to die, and you really shouldn't have many rights anymore. They've done lots of horrible things, and some of them may want to do one final good deed. Why not allow these people to make one last decision for the better?

First of all, I don't think that the state should be allowed to force the prisoners to donate organs. That would create an added incentive to giving people the death sentence. Jurors may even take that into consideration when pondering their verdict. These effects all want to be avoided in case of abuse.

There is however the problem that people may try to become organ donors to gain sympathy and show that they've somehow changed. I think that issue can be fixed by only giving them the option to become organ donors a short period before the actual execution, after all sentencing as been done.

Of course we wouldn't be able to poison the crap out of their bodies as a form of execution anymore, but I don't think people were particularly attached to that form of execution. I'm sure they can figure out a way to humanely kill someone while preserving their organs.

We would also have to make sure that they're disease free and their organs are qualified for donation, but I think doctors have to do that anyway, so I don't think that will be a big issue.

All that being said, I think death row inmates should be a given this last chance to do some good if they so choose. The organs could save multiple lives and they would just be going to waste otherwise.</selfText></submission>

According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter), some cases of voluntary manslaughter involve an intent to kill that is tempered by mitigating circumstances. I am not discussing those cases in this post. The cases I am interested in are those that involve no intent to kill: Voluntary manslaughter where the intent was to cause serious harm but not death and the various forms involuntary manslaughter. 

There is a fundamental difference between manslaughter and most other crimes that I can think of (If you can think of any that are like manslaughter, then I probably have a problem with them as well): manslaughter criminalizes the consequences of an individual’s actions rather than the actions themselves. An individual can perform the exact same actions twice in indistinguishable circumstances, but get unlucky one of those times and accidentally kill someone. In the case where no one died, that individual might be charged with reckless endangerment, criminal assault/battery, etc… or even nothing at all depending on the action. In the case where someone died, that individual would be charged with the same crime in addition to manslaughter. In New York, a conviction of First Degree Reckless Endangerment for a first time felony offender has no minimum sentence and a maximum sentence of 7 years in prison (http://www.new-york-lawyers.org/reckless-endangerment.html). A conviction of  second-degree manslaughter carries a sentence of 3 to 15 years in prison (http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-involuntary-manslaughter-laws.html). This means that in two cases where identical reckless actions are performed, the maximum sentence could be 3 times as long (7 max in the first case, 22 max in the second case) if someone gets killed. This difference is essentially entirely a matter of luck.

A good example is that of drunk driving. If two different people are who are equally inebriated both decide to make a 12 mile drive at rush hour in New York, but one hits and kills a pedestrian and the other is stopped by the police, they face very different consequences. The penalty for a DUI in New York is up to a year in jail for the first offense (http://dui.drivinglaws.org/newyork.php). The penalty for killing someone while under the influence (vehicular manslaughter in the first degree) is up to 15 years (http://www.madd.org/laws/law-overview/Vehicular_Homicide_Overview.pdf). Is it reasonable to punish these two identical actions with completely different sentences because the consequences were different in the two cases? Shouldn’t the actions that the offender has control over be subject to judicial actions rather than the consequences of those actions.

Note: I have class and work now, so I’ll be back in the evening.

Edit: Having read the comments, I've decided that the DUI example is too complicated -- it involves a continuous action and too many variables, so consider this example from one of my responses instead:

&gt;Imagine that someone in New York throws a brick out of a 10th story window onto Broadway without looking. Another person a block down does the same thing at the same time. The first brick hits the ground harmlessly, while the second brick hits a person in the head, killing them. I'm having trouble finding a law on defenestration on Google, but I imagine the first case would qualify as reckless endangerment, while the second case would qualify as reckless endangerment and as manslaughter. I described the corresponding sentences in the OP. Do you think that these two people should be charged differently?

<submission><id>15</id><identifier>1et89u</identifier><title>The Iraq War was both just and necessary. CMV.</title><commentCount>122</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1et89u/the_iraq_war_was_both_just_and_necessary_cmv/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Alright, I think it's time that I had a proper discussion about this. **I firmly believe that the decision to move Iraq, the Middle East, and the region into a post-Saddam Hussein era was a moral and legal imperative for the United States and the international community and that force of arms was the only feasible way to accomplish that.** That's my position, in a sentence. I hope the post title doesn't misrepresent that.

Here's why:

1) There are four reasons for which a sovereign state may lose or sacrifice its sovereignty under international law.

* It has invaded or occupied a neighboring state.
* It has violated or proposed to violate the Genocide Convention
* It has displayed promiscuous and frivolous behavior with (or plainly violated) the Non-Proliferation Treaty
* It has actively harbored internationally wanted terrorists and gangsters

Iraq is the only modern state to have violated all four of those. It had attempted to annex Kuwait and make it part of Iraq, as well as engage in a pointless border dispute with Iran that cost thousands of lives. Saddam had issued a direct order to exterminate the Kurdish people of Iraq. He did this using biological and chemical weapons. Further, he maintained a department of state for the concealment of nuclear weapons. Although none were found during the invasion, he had stated that he wished to rebuild the nuclear program once the sanctions ceased. Finally, his country was the homebase of Abu-Nidal, Zarqawi, and the Achille Lauro hijackers from the PLF. 

This meant that the international community had a duty, as well as a right, to remove the regime from power by any justifiable means, including and up to use of deadly force.

2) Saddam Hussein and his crime family had sole ownership of all of the natural resources and imports to Iraq. The sanctions were in effect because he was able to use his power to keep the Iraqi people in his jaws, while they starved. Furthermore, he was in possession of some of the largest oil reserves in the world. He was able to do as he liked with them, and he was the sole profiteer of them. This was, in my opinion, an outrageous offense to anyone who cared about the economic well-being of both the country and the Middle East as a whole.

3) Saddam Hussein only ever called a cabinet meeting when he ordered one half of the cabinet to shoot the other half, sealing them in complicity with his regime. A person could be publicly executed for spilling their coffee on the newspaper that had Saddam's face on it, after which the person's family would be billed for the bullets. People died horrible deaths every day for no other reason than the egotistical glorification of a known psychopath and criminal. Morally, an international community that had any regard for decency could not stand by while this regime behaved like that.

Note: this is **not** an endorsement of the Bush administration. I believe wholly that their execution of the war was abysmal. Their reasons as stated to the American electorate were appallingly cheap and demagogic. They didn't level with us on any of the goings-on in the war while it was happening. They may have even committed a war crime or two. But, that isn't what this question is about.

This question is not about 9/11. My case would have been exactly the same in 1998 (with the exception of Zarqawi, I believe). In fact, it would have been almost complete during the Kuwait War. This question is not about mistakes that were made. It's solely about whether we, as citizens of a global community, were willing to stand by with our guns holstered while our Iraqi brothers and sisters were under the control of the Saddam Hussein regime.

CMV.

**EDIT**: Oh lawd. I've been going at it all day and my brain is fried, but inspired. I just want to say:

1) Some of you guys have had the best arguments I've yet heard against my position. Definitely the best on reddit. I'm gonna keep coming back here, for sure, and not just for my own post. Thank you, sincerely, and keep them coming.

2) Having said that, I feel the need to make something abundantly clear: my contention is not "America has made nothing but good foreign policy decisions ever since the Declaration". It's also not "Bush did the right thing during his execution of the war". It's also not "Bush Sr. was right". It's also not "Bush Sr. was wrong". It's not "X politician made Y statement and that proves me right". I'm very deliberately **making my own case**, separate from any case anybody else made. I'm serious: if I get one more post that starts with "BUT BUSH SAID..." I'm going to go all Bane-backbreaker on my laptop.

3) But seriously, keep it up.

4) &lt;3

5) Also, I'm going to bed right now. It's midnight here in the Philippines and I need sleep. If you leave a response, I'll answer it sometime tomorrow. Scout's honor.

**EDIT 2**: Thanks again for all the incredible insight. I know we're just a bunch of nerds debating politics on reddit, but still. I think I really gained a lot. Particular shout-outs to /u/maxtheman and /u/username_6916, who I've given deltas to for their unique points of view on this issue. This thread appears to be in its death throes, but if anybody wants to keep talking about this, I promise I'll respond if you leave a comment.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>16</id><identifier>44t6uq</identifier><title>CMV: Attempting to ban "hate-speech" is, itself, hate-speech.</title><commentCount>121</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/44t6uq/cmv_attempting_to_ban_hatespeech_is_itself/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I want to set up this premise by mentioning a few things:

* I am not talking about genuine hate speech. For example, if a redneck harasses a black man about their race to the point of logical fear, logical meant to portray reality rather than emotion, that would be considered genuine hate-speech and should have laws protecting people from that.

* I *am* referring to hate-speech as being the systematic oppression of political dissidents by, typically, the self-proclaimed oppressed. In my argument I will be expanding upon the term "political dissidents" and "self-proclaimed oppressed." Albeit indirectly at times.

**First, examples of non-hate-speech:**

* Free-speech organizations, such as those on university campuses. While they do support other's to speak more broadly, and admittedly, more hatefully, their acts are not hate-speech.

* The vocalized desire to build a wall, while stupid, is not hate speech. Even if it comes with "to keep those damn Mexicans' out; so they don't take 'er jobs." (obvious redneck impersonation is obvious). Even with that overtly offensive remark: it *is not hate-speech* nor should it ever be considered hate-speech.

* The desire to reject muslims from coming to America, while not helping them, is not hate speech.

* West Borrow Baptist church saying "God hates fags," while very offensive, *is not hate-speech.* It is *hateful* and, yes, it is speech, but the term "Hate-speech" as it should be legally defined, should not apply to it.

* Expressing political views *that could lead* to hate-speech *is not, itself, hate-speech*. Thus, it **must** be protected.

**Second, examples of genuine hate-speech:**

* Attempts to ban free-speech organizations.

* Attempts to get someone fired over their inflammatory remarks.

* Attempts to get people expelled from school over certain taboo words.

* Attempts to boycott companies for their political views.

* Attempts to fire people, or have them not allowed to perform, for acts they committed no matter how evil and wrong. Tiger Woods is my prime example.

**So why do I feel the first set of examples are *not* hate-speech while the second are?**

In the first set of scenarios, while it is true that they often *lead* to hate-speech, you must not make the mistake of condemning them for it. This is because these are positions informed by **political ideologies**. Thus, it **is** the oppression of political dissidents.

The only reason that what they do would be wrong is when it hinders another person's own right to free speech. **All forms of "wrong" are defined by the limitation of that person's free-speech. Even murder.**

* Murder would not be wrong if it did not result in the person being perfectly able to voice themselves through actions and word. 

* Rape is wrong because it hinders a person's ability to cognate; thus restricting their free-speech.

As such, the examples of *actual* hate-speech are examples whereby a person's ability to freely voice their opinion is prohibited. Not only for their inflammatory remarks, but their ability to continue life in a reasonable fashion.

**Finally, a counter-point to address and get it out of the way**

* But what about people who are victimized by hateful words?! 

They surely feel terrible about what has been said which could lead to altering their views of the world and possibly put them in a position to commit suicide.

However, plentiful examples have been illustrated that it *isn't* a death sentence and in many cases people easily get through it. You are no more a criminal for clapping your hands, leading to a butterfly effect, which eventually results in a death elsewhere in the world as you are to that individual. Only when your speech is followed by the potential actualization of enforcement does your speech have merit.

If a person is raised to think that they are unable to succeed in life then a single remark *should not* be able to throw them off from their ability to succeed. Additionally, that one remark is the *least* of their concerns.

Often humans build up emotions of failure from many sources and unleash them at any given source; even if that source is insignificant. This is the exact same scenario.

**IN CLOSING**

There is, in fact, a massive wave of hate-speech in our society, but it is not from the sources you'd expect. The people practicing the majority of hate-speech are the people who claim to stand for justice. I additionally feel that the laws are insufficient to combat hate-speech and should be extended to protect people from being fired for simply voicing their political views.

I figure this is a very controversial subject, as such, I expect to carry on this argument for the following weeks. Remember to be civil and, most importantly, have fun.

**EDIT:** There's quite a lot of confusion about my points and my position; so here's a clarification:

* Hate Crimes are illegal in the US; both by the law of the same name and by The Equal Opportunity Act. If you are fired simply because you are gay you have every right to peruse legal action. I am saying that people who are fired because of a mob should *also* have that right as well as the right to bring charges against those that attempted to get them fired.

* This argument is **mostly** about the US government; using the First Amendment as reference. If you want to make this about countries in the EU feel free- that would be enjoyable to me, but would vastly change my argument. I'm defending the Hate Crime definition here, but wanting to expand it. With EU countries it would be the opposite as some of them will fine you for making anti-muslim remarks.

**EDIT2:** A Delta has been awarded! I had the serious error of misuse of terms which apparently confused quite a lot of people. A user made an argument which pointed out *just how badly* I was misusing the term and made me realize the damage to my own position I was doing. That term was **Hate-Speech.**

**For all future argument** I will be talking about this with reference to Hate-Crimes and the Equal Opportunity Act (as well as similar laws); I'm dropping the term "Hate-Speech" completely from this argument.

**EDIT3:** Another Delta about the misuse of terms. Geez! I really need to work on that. In this case it was about **fear**. I meant to refer to circumstances that would *cause* it in a manner you'd... Think... It would. Yeah, poorly thought out by me. I was more concerned with illustrating the point than I was about making the point solid. Woops.

<submission><id>17</id><identifier>1kkupx</identifier><title>I think that the War on Drugs could be won (nearly non-existant drug use) if we got very serious about it; CMV</title><commentCount>121</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1kkupx/i_think_that_the_war_on_drugs_could_be_won_nearly/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>When having arguments with others about legalizing drugs, one point often brought up is that the War on Drugs is impossible to win and therefore is a wasted effort.

While I would agree under the current policy that this is true, I think that it could be won if we were willing to get very serious about it.  

Specifically, if we made drug offenses (both felonies and misdemeanors) into capital crimes, then people would either stop using/selling/manufacturing drugs or the ones who didn't stop would be eliminated through execution.

Implementation of this policy would coincide with a grace period of several months and free access to rehab, counseling, and other services for addicts who need help quitting. 

Now, I will fully concede that this is mostly hypothetical since the US would never undertake such a policy (and it might require constitutional changes to even allow), but I think that it is an option that would be successful at winning the War on Drugs.  

Winning is defined as little to no usage of illegal drugs within the country. Quantitatively, if [around 9% of Americans currently use illegal drugs](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k10NSDUH/2k10Results.htm), winning the war would be something like &lt; .1% using drugs.

As an aside, this solution would also nullify arguments about problems with the prison system, since we would no longer have to worry about overcrowding, recidivism, etc.

**TL;DR: The War on Drugs could be won if we made the punishment for drug crimes an automatic death sentence.**

*EDIT: I should mention that I do think drugs should be legalized purely on the merits of individual freedoms, I just mostly take issue with people who say that they should be legalized because the War on Drugs can't be won or because of problems in the prison system.*</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>18</id><identifier>27869d</identifier><title>CMV: Reddit's attitude and response to people being killed when they commit a crime is not only creepy but indicative of why America has such massive social problems</title><commentCount>110</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/27869d/cmv_reddits_attitude_and_response_to_people_being/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Whenever there is a post or video that shows someone, normally a burglar, being shot by a homeowner the response in the comments is normally at best: "It sucks that someone died, but they forfeited their lives the moment they broke into the house". At worse and quite often this attitude can lose the first part of the sentence and end up, if not exactly celebrating the death then at least saying it was no bad thing. While it is important to acknowledge that Reddit is not one entity and so has a varied opinion it seems that the top voted comment is consistently of this view and so can be extrapolated to present a majority opinion. If we want further proof the popularity of justice porn, which brings with it the same views and attitudes to the people being beaten up or otherwise hurt. 

My problem with this is this take on human relationships is it revolves around the idea that the people who commit crimes or act immorally deserve punishment. It is sometimes acknowledged that the punishment is disproportionate, but I would go even further and say the idea of punishment does not make much sense. The people who rob and steal do so because of factors outside their control: namely social factors and to a lesser extent their genetics. Crime is tightly linked to inequality and poverty, it comes about when a society is failing its people. This is not even an argument that people might be stealing not out of greed but of necessity, although that might be the case, but that even if they *are* stealing out of greed it is only because society tells them that is right.

Never in the comment sections is there mention of trying to improve the lives of people, which would almost certainly prevent the situation in the first place. It is this view that allows for the terrible prison system in the US. Reddit likes to talk about the Drug War being the root of the problem (which I agree is **an** issue, just not **the** issue) but often overlooks the aim of the prison system in America. The American prison system is there to punish those who commit crimes, with the idea of "justice being served" at the heart. The aim of prisons should be to rehabilitate instead of punish. It is only in the most extreme cases, where rehabilitation is simply not possible, that a prison should act as nothing but a way to keep the very dangerous separate from the general populace. It is the attitude towards punishment and the idea that people deserve what they get that allows for the death penalty in America, which to me is immoral beyond words.

If we take the news and Reddit to give an accurate view of America then it appears that the American people are far more concerned with their own rights than they are with helping others. The arguments surrounding possible gun control are always based around the rights of the people. Few people want to talk about how to reduce inequality, improve mental health care or improve education. When there is greater talk about what rights the people should have, as in negative freedom, over what responsibilities the people and state have to one another, as in positive freedom, you get the results seen in America.

<submission><id>19</id><identifier>4s6p9b</identifier><title>CMV: I have failed to rationalize objective or inherent Right and Wrong</title><commentCount>117</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4s6p9b/cmv_i_have_failed_to_rationalize_objective_or/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Right and Wrong, Good and Bad

It seems like most people I have come across believe right and wrong and good and evil are objective or inherent things.

Sometime ago, I held that view, but after experiencing a loss sometimes ago, I began to think about the subject in a more existential sense. I have failed to come up with a set of criteria for evaluating something as right or wrong that did not fall apart under scrutiny. More on that later.

My understanding is that right and wrong are either objective or they are not; that it is a null and alternate kind of problem where if right and wrong are objective, they are not subjective and vice versa.

I am uncertain as to how the burden of proof factors into this question, but my current (and I acknowledge likely incorrect) understanding would be that those who make the claim (in this case being the claim that right and wrong are objective or inherent) are the ones who must substantiate the claim.

I have tried to substantiate the claim myself, but have found what I can come up with unsatisfying. In googling the question, I have not been able to rationalize the ways others have substantiated it either, though I acknowledge it’s likely I simply failed to grasp what they meant or that I understood improperly.

Where I started was trying to come up with a set of criteria for evaluating right and wrong. Are right and wrong determined by feelings and sensibilities? Are they determined by general consensus or the law? Are they determined by god(s) or religion?

I think each of these has its problems. Feelings and sensibilities are disagreed upon. Some are appalled by eating meat while others are not. Some see guns as an evil and some do not. If I felt murder was fine, that would not necessarily make it so. Alternatively, if I felt murder was not fine, that would not necessarily make it so. You can take metrics on the majority view, but this leads us to general consensus which I think has its own problems.

I think the problem with general consensus is that it only means what most people think; it says nothing about the truth or correctness of what most people think. By the logic of general consensus, if most people believed murder and rape were just and right, they simply would be. My understanding is that in Rome, many people had no problem with gladiators or the arena. General consensus can vary depending on time period, location, people groups, and so on. It has also arguably changed over time with things like slavery or homosexuality as an example. Some groups still oppose homosexuality which is often due to one of the next systems for making criteria which uses god(s) or religion as the ultimate determinant for right and wrong (which I think has its own problems). General consensus is not necessarily indicative of truth or falseness. It only means what the majority think or feel which can be incorrect as seen throughout history with regards to many fields of study. Simply because the majority once believed the earth was flat at one time does not mean they were correct.

Regarding the law, Captain Picard has a quote I like where he says, “There can be no justice so long as laws are absolute.” 

Suppose person A drives drunk and gets into a car accident killing an elderly couple. In this scenario, the accident is entirely the elderly couples fault and driving error (they were driving the wrong way on a one way highway or something); let’s assume it would have happened regardless of the drinking.

Now suppose person B drives drunk and gets into an accident killing the elderly couple. In this case, it is entirely his error.

Should the two of them be punished in the same manner by the law? Should person A receive something more akin to a DUI while person B receive a more severe sentence? Should they receive the same sentence?

The law deals with a practically infinite number of edge cases which can cause problems when something like the above case occurs and you have a flat law to deal with it. Whether a flat law is sufficient for both person A and B is debatable. Some I speculate would be fine with person A and B being punished the same way while some I speculate would not.

Furthermore, laws can also be arguably unjust. I don’t think I need to give examples of that, it’s rather evident throughout history that at least some societies had laws that I think most would consider wrong by today’s developed country standards. I do not think that simply because laws change over time that old laws are necessarily wrong or that new laws are necessarily right.

Finally, we get to god(s) or religion as a means for evaluating right and wrong. The problem with this, I think, is that it does not take into account what god(s) does and does not do and only makes sense to me in a kind of, “He who has the gold makes the rules” way. By this method for developing criteria, god could, say, destroy all of humanity with a flood and this be considered right or have his people engage in religious justified genocide and this be considered objectively right because he said to do it and he makes the rules. It also makes right and wrong simply dependent on the whims and desires of the most powerful being (or something in that vein) regarding the “He who has the gold makes the rules bit.” Once again, if this were our determinant for right and wrong, god(s) could simply decree murder and rape to be just and right and, by our criteria, they would be.

Perhaps most importantly, which of these methods for determining right and wrong take precedence when they disagree with one another? What if my religion conflicts with the law or general consensus? What if my personal feelings and sensibilities conflict with one or both of the other two? What if your order of precedence differs from my own? Which of us is more objectively correct? 

It seems many people I have spoken with develop guiding principles such as, “If it hurts someone, it’s wrong.”

For starters, I speculate a good many people are hypocrites on this point and do not apply this principle uniformly. For example, suppose some friends go out with person A. Person A does not want to drive so he lets person B in the group do it even though he is aware that  person B is inconvenienced by it. This is good for Person A and bad for Person B. One could argue it helps person A and hurts person B. 

In a different scenario, suppose person A breaks up with person and starts dating person C. Person B has their dreams crushed, loses their partner and best friend, and is depressed for years. In this case person A did what was in their best interest regardless of the pain to person B.

In both of the above scenarios, I speculate that whether or not the actions of person A are right or wrong might be debated to a degree, but by our aforementioned principle, I think both would be wrong.

Where do we draw the line when using principles like this? Is it at death and murder? Is it in small things like going out to eat with friends our letting our spouse do the laundry? But all of this is beside the point and I speculate many would admit that they believe the principle is true absolutely and that they simply don’t follow it in all things because of their nature, personal failings, or something in that vein. But I digress. The hypocrisy and uncertainty of people tells us nothing about the validity of the principle itself.

I think the biggest issue with a principle like this is that it is grounded in one of the items we’ve addressed: the wheel of feelings and sensibilities, law or general consensus, or god(s)/religion which are each fallible by my current understanding.

My conclusion is that right and wrong are ultimately rooted in self-interest and human needs. I acknowledge that empirically we see trends regarding the views on right and wrong that people hold, but I think that these trends are fallible because they depend on our wheel of criteria. Right and wrong exist, sure, but they exist because we made them up for self-interest or mutual self-interest.

I don’t want you stealing from my shop. I agree not to steal from you if you don’t steal from me. I won’t take your seat if you sat in it first on the condition that you don’t take my seat when I sit their first. Some people will say I’ll respect your beliefs so long as you respect my beliefs and on and on it goes.

My understanding is that these are social contracts which are fine examples of mutual self-interest at work.

I am aware of the question, “Is selflessness ultimately selfish?” If the answer is yes (I think it is), then I think we are left with another question: Does selflessness exist at all? Again, I would say ultimately no, it does not. Provided these assumptions are correct, I think the result would be that the choices we make are based on cost analysis; we factor in our personal feelings and sensibilities, our religion, our desires, our understanding of the consequences, our cultural influence, our human needs and programming, and so on, and then make what we see as the best choice given the circumstances.

I think if this is true, than it has certain ramifications that I speculate a lot of people won’t like very much (though naturally what we like or what makes us happy is hardly indicative of a universal truth). With this logic in mind, suppose we have person A who wants to murder someone. Now, person A has evaluated the consequences of his actions (death or lifetime imprisonment), evaluated the risk of capture, and then decided by cost analysis that murdering the person is worth the consequences. By this logic, it is not wrong (at least not universally) for him to do this then I don’t think.

Suppose a different person A exists who is married to person B. Suppose Person B chooses to run off with a younger woman and leave person A and his kids. Suppose person B evaluated the consequences of losing his wife, his children, and his wealth from the split, but still decides he wants to do it; that it’s worth it. By this logic, it is not wrong for him to do this then I don’t think.

Regarding contracts, they are only valid as long as they are in all the party’s best self interest. If a party evaluates the consequences of breaking the contract, but still deems breaking it worth the consequences, if follows that it is not wrong for them to break it. Rather, it is perhaps bad for the other parties involved so they won’t like it and may think the action wrong and do what is in their power to rebalance their own self-interest.

If someone lies to get what they want truly understanding the risks and consequences, but chooses to do so regardless after careful cost analysis it follows that it is not wrong to do so.

If selflessness is ultimately selfish and right and wrong are ultimately built on self-interest, what is right for you and what is right for someone else may be entirely different; right and wrong are only objectively definable with regards to one’s goals and personal cost analysis algorithms.

I speculate many will say, “People would do crappy things all the time and the world would fall apart if this were true,” but I disagree.

People are interdependent. We need each other to meet our needs. People must give to get. People may be kind because if they are rude or mean, people will not like them and they’ll be unable to meet their own needs. People have emotions and feelings; empathy and programming to gain happiness from those they love or are emotionally close to. I think it could be argued that we are programmed to do nice things for the people we cherish and, quite frankly, we must if we want to keep them. I think many people hold core beliefs that it is right or the correct and proper way to live to treat people well (though again, I speculate many people haven’t thought it through as well as they think and practice hypocrisy in their principles as explained above).

Some I have spoken with have presented love as something pure and unselfish. I think that love is selfish -- an exchange of goods to meet each other’s needs. It has been said that to fall in love is to desire to own. Maybe you acknowledge love is temporary and relationships always end for one reason or another at some point in time and don’t get so attached or possessive. It could again be argued that your behavior is ultimately rooted in self interest in order to avoid future pain.

Regarding the belief that chaos would ensue if this logic were correct, even if right and wrong don’t really inherently exist and are just human constructs for self-interest, I still think it makes sense that laws and punishment exist because consequences factor into our choices and cost analysis. A community with similar goals might want to set up a standard of rules for mutual self interest and then have consequences to protect the interests of the majority. I think it could be argued that discrimination, slavery, tyranny, and so on, eventually work themselves out because they are things that are not in the best self-interest of those oppressed and so the oppressed end up fighting those in power and appeal to the empathy of those around them. People unaffected might be moved to help those oppressed due to their empathy or varying factors of their cost analysis. By my conclusion, slavery is not inherently right or wrong, we deemed it right or wrong depending on various factors of self-interest, mutual self-interest, and cost analysis.

I think a problem with inherent or objective right and wrong is that it turns into a game of “Who said so?” Person A says it’s wrong to hurt something living. Person B says, “Who says so? Why?” Person A lists some of our failed criteria from above. Even if 100% of humanity agreed on a code for right and wrong, it would not be inherent, but rather what we as a community decided based on our cost analysis and inescapable drive for self-interest. Would the universe care that 100% of humanity agreed that murder was wrong? No, I do not think it would. If someone shot me in the head right now, I would not like it because it is not what I want and not in my best self-interest, but I cannot argue that it is inherently wrong. Right and wrong are just words for things that we like or do not like; things that are bad for us or good for us; things that go against our programming or core beliefs and things that do not.

Regret can be explained by people having inadequate information and making the best cost analysis judgement they can, but realizing later it was a poorer decision than they could have made.

Ultimately, I think right and wrong are not inherent, but rather the end result of self-interest. I think this means that what is right and wrong for one person may not be for another.

My view on this is very unpopular and I speculate most people in the world don’t buy this. If I’m incorrect, I’d like to know because I want to have an accurate world view. The truth is the goal.

Thank you very much. I’m sorry for the long read.

P.S.

Ultimately, this is all very important to me because it is effecting my happiness. As it stands, I acknowledge that the truth is neither good or bad, sad or happy, but I feel very sad regarding my world view and conclusions because, to me, it seems like it is impossible for anyone to ever really value or care about me. At the root, they are really just caring about themselves and meeting their own needs even if they don’t see it that way. It is the same way with me. If I love someone, my love is not unconditional and ultimately they are just something that meets my needs and makes me happy. The best one can do is play the game of mutual self-interest and try to meet your needs while trading others yourself so you meet their needs. All the while acknowledging that no one owes you a thing and that people can and will leave or swap you out for something that meets their needs better than you can. I have accepted this, but I feel incredibly sad about it all. If selflessness is selfish than I and everyone else are ultimately just out for ourselves. No matter what choices we make, self-interest appears to be inescapable. I used to be religious, but now I would say the closest thing I am is a Nihilist. Now, Nihilism is not necessarily sad, that’s not what I’m saying. Personally, I have felt depressed and alone for several years. I don’t think I’d ever commit suicide because it is possible something unforeseen might occur to improve my circumstances. I don’t smoke or do drugs, I rarely drink, and I don’t have any friends I respect or that I would mind losing. I’m very proud of my job (though I feel incredibly underqualified, like a pretender, and my work worries me in the sense that I am not confident that I will be able to handle the task they assign me next) and I am young at only 22. For some context, that loss I was referring to earlier in the post was very significant to me. I lost everything at more or less the same time. I lost my dream, my partner and best friend, my religion, and my core beliefs and principles and have been dealing with it all more or less by myself with some reading. It’s been 2 years and I’ve reached a lot of conclusions, but it hasn’t helped me to be happy again. I blame myself. I was on track to have everything I wanted then it all fell apart because I was too ignorant and indoctrinated to know better. I cannot forgive myself for ruining my own life. It’s too late, I cannot go back, and I have accepted that this is the outcome I must live with, but I am powerless and frustrated by my mistakes.

On the rare occasions this stuff comes up in conversation, most people think I am insane; that my views are evil or obviously incorrect based on common sense. My family and university are religious so my views are ridiculed quite frequently.

I, like all people, want to be happy. I want to love my life and have no regrets (too late for that regrets bit).

How should I proceed? If my worldview is wrong, please tell me why. I feel utterly powerless.

Thank you again for your help and time and for sticking with it for such a long read. I really appreciate it. I am sure there’s a better place for this, but I don’t really know where else to go to be honest. Just writing this has been helpful for me. If you made it through it all, you’re a champ.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>20</id><identifier>2dygof</identifier><title>CMV:Death row inmates should either not be allowed to make any appeals at all or a minimum of one</title><commentCount>101</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2dygof/cmvdeath_row_inmates_should_either_not_be_allowed/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Let me start by saying I am NOT here to debate on whether or not the death penalty is justified. I'm here to debate my view concerning appeals and what happens after someone lands on death row. Let us also assume that our hypothetical death row inmate is proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt and is most definitely guilty of the crimes that have landed him on death row in the first place.

A common argument against the death penalty is that it costs many times more than just letting a convict rot in prison for the rest of his life. This is true only because of appeals made by the death row inmate which can run into millions of dollars of taxpayers' money wasted and years wasted just so he can get executed anyway.

The only reason why the death penalty costs so much is because of all the stupid and useless appeals filed by pro-bono law groups in the names of death row inmates for no other reason than to make the process more expensive so that later on they can complain about how expensive the process is. They create the problem within a system they disagree with so they can complain about the problem with the system. You shouldn't create a large flaw and then use it as evidence that you are correct.

A counter argument to my view could be that the death row inmate still deserves a right to appeal regardless of his actions or the fact that he is on death row. My argument against that is as follows:

 We have decided as a nation and a society that some crimes are so heinous that they deserve the worst punishment, meaning taking someone's life away or their taking their right to live away. Many would agree that a person's life is the most valuable thing you can ever possess and is the only thing that truly belongs to you. Now if we have a justice system that deems it justifiable and acceptable to take someone's life away if they have been proven of committing certain horrible crimes like murder in a court of law, then I really don't think taking away a death row inmate's right to appeal is that big of a deal and something to get angry over.

If new evidence is found that casts doubt on a person's guilt, then I can see why an appeal would be necessary. The key word is IF. In our hypothetical situation the person being disallowed of making an appeal or multiple appeals is 100% guilty. An example would be they were found holding the murder weapon standing over the victim covered in their blood laughing maniacly. So no evidence in the world can save them from execution.

That leaves one alternative to our usual costly method of multiple million dollar appeals that take years and years to process. A bullet costs less than $2. A rope costs less than $15 dollars and is reusable. Hell you could recruit people off the street that own their own gun and bullets who would be WILLING to execute a death row murderer or mass murderer. 

The inmate is dead and justice is served at little to zero to the taxpayers in a timely and efficient manner. I can't really think of any good counter arguments to my view but that is where you guys come in. Change my view!

Edit: Since people are saying my hypothetical situation defeats the purpose of appeals I'm going to narrow it down to the real world. My argument now is that not every single person on death row should be allowed appeals or multiple appeals if the case for their guilt is too grear for their claimed innocence to be **Reasonably** faced. Someone like a serial killer or a mass shooter who guns a bunch of people down in public in clear view of everyone and the police. Letting someone like that appeal over and over again to the point their scheduled execution is a decade or more away, all the while mocking the justice system and wasting millions of dollars and vast amounts of resources, is wrong and completely ridiculous. Our current system is greatly flawed due to the fact that any prisoner regardless of the case against them can and will abuse and exploit the appeals system to delay their impending death with the help of lawyers and pro bono law groups who then use the large cost as proof that we shouldn't have the death penalty, even though they are making the problem even worse than it should be while claiming the moral high ground. 

Here is a link describing how horrible and inefficient it is currently: http://m.sfgate.com/opinion/saunders/article/The-triumph-of-dubious-death-penalty-appeals-5631469.php

California has sentenced 900 people to the death penalty since 1972 and executed 13. The average stay for a death row inmate in California is over 15 years long due to them filing appeal after appeal. Most of them die of old age rather than getting executed. This is greatly inefficient and ridiculous and anyone should be able to see that 13 out of 900 sentenced is sad. That is little over 1 percent of the total prisoners sentenced to the death penalty since 1972. Anyone who looks at this as anything near acceptable and proper justice is being ridiculous and most of all mistaken. 

 The cost of the death penalty in California has totaled over $4 billion since 1978. I wonder how much of it was spent unnecessarily on appeals that only resulted in extending the criminal's life and nothing more

Link describing the appeals process: 
http://criminal.lawyers.com/criminal-law-basics/death-sentence-appeals-take-time-for-a-reason.html

In 2010, a death row inmate waited an average of 178 months (or close to 15 years) between sentencing and execution. Nearly a quarter of deaths on death row in the U.S. are due to natural causes. More evidence our current appeals system is a joke and should be improved upon.

<submission><id>21</id><identifier>1kjas7</identifier><title>Living in almost any European country is vastly superior to living in America. CMV</title><commentCount>101</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1kjas7/living_in_almost_any_european_country_is_vastly/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I'll get right into it. With few (any?) exceptions, Europe is WAY better to live in than America. I'll list nearly every reason I can think of. The list may seem a bit nitpicky, but I feel every reason contributes in some way to the quality of life in both areas.

The first criticism I expect to get is that I am simply picking and choosing ways Europe is superior while ignoring ways in which America has the upper-hand. For this reason, a second list will be included, listing ways I think America is better than Europe.

Let's begin:

1. More vacation time and shorter working hours. Europeans get far more vacation time and shorter work weeks. Yet they are still more productive per capita than America is. In addition, they get mandated maternity and sick leave.

2. Europeans have universal healthcare. Yes, this is paid by taxes, but it is far more affordable for everyone and no one is disqualified because of a medical condition. In addition, over half of all bankruptcies in America are because of medical debt. And having insurance doesn't help anything at all. In America, you can go bankrupt at any time through no fault of your own.

http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/over-60-of-all-us-bankruptcies-attributable-to-medical-problems

3. Americans no longer have pensions and will not be able to retire in the future. Most European jobs have guaranteed pensions.

Sources: http://washingtoninformer.com/news/2013/jul/17/americas-crisis-38-million-no-retirement-assets/
http://www.infowars.com/the-tip-of-the-iceberg-of-the-coming-retirement-crisis-that-will-shake-america-to-the-core/
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/americans-not-saving-for-retirement

4. Americans do not have universal education, meaning Americans are drowning in debt before they even get into the workforce. This is virtually unheard of in Europe.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt
http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/student-debt-and-the-crushing-of-the-american-dream/?_r=0

Those are actually the main reasons right there. Those 4 reasons alone should make you want to move to Europe. I have one life to live. Spending it $200k in student debt working 80 hours a week with 0 vacation time and no retirement with the looming fear that you can go bankrupt and lose it all at any time is an absolutely horrible way to live life. I would honestly rather kill myself than live like this. But there's a better solution: move to a civilized country. Here are more reasons:

5. Europeans have less intrusive advertisements and have less blatant corporate advertising than America. Huge billboards are considered distracting to drivers in Europe and there are fewer commercials on TV.

6. The food is better in Europe. Europeans have stricter methods than the FDA of their food supply. They have a more balanced diet and eat less fast food than Americans.

7. Almost every nation besides America uses the metric system, which is far more efficient and simpler, with less mistakes resulting from inaccurate measurements. In addition, they use the "Day Month Year" method on their calendars and use a 24 hour clock.

8. Europeans use manual transmission on their cars, which up until recently was more fuel efficient than automatic cars.

9. Americans incarcerate more people and serve longer jail sentences than any other developed country. Most of those serving are in for drug related offenses, something uncommon in Europe. Europeans understand that prison is for rehabilitation, not punishment. In addition, America still uses the death penalty.

10. America has the largest military budget in the world and uses it to wage war against foreign nations for little rational reason. If we spent even a third of that budget for education and healthcare, we could join the rest of the developed world in having universal healthcare and education.

11. Americans have far more gun crime and gun related deaths.

12. Many Americans (certainly not all or even most though) hate criticisms of their country and treat it as "God's country." This blind patriotism is unheard of in Europe.

13. Infant circumcision is common in America, but considered immoral by most Europeans unless it's voluntary.

14. Europeans include taxes on their prices automatically, but in America you have to manually add it, which is inconvenient and misleads the consumer into thinking something is cheaper than it really is.

15. Americans are more obese and unhealthy than most Europeans.

Some more controversial ones:

16. Nudity is considered taboo in America, but is common in Europe. I see no reason why a naked body should be considered immoral or taboo, but I do not want a debate about this.

17. Americans are far more religious. Again, very controversial, but I consider this a bad thing.

18. Europeans are more open about drugs, abortion, gay marriage, etc. Again, I'm not trying to have a debate about these topics specifically. These could obviously go either way for many people, so please do not attack my argument on these points alone.

And now for the American list:

1. Americans pay lower taxes resulting in higher take-home pay. Although it could also be argued the other way. Europeans pay higher taxes because they have a wider, more encompassing safety net. It results in less personal take-home pay, but higher financial security.

2. Americans tend to pay less than most for housing, cars, alcohol, etc.

3. Assuming you are successful in America, you could have a better life than almost anyone, European or otherwise. America has tremendous wealth inequality (which should be included in my reasons above) which for 99% of people is horrible. But if you claw your way to the upper echelons of the successful 1%, you could live a life of luxury beyond almost anything Europe has to offer.

That's pretty much all I've got. Sad, isn't it?

Also, before anyone points it out, I realize my sources aren't exactly scholarly. I chose sources mainly for ease of reading. However, most of them cite credible studies and the same information could easily be found in a more scholarly format with some more research. I'm here to argue why America doesn't have paid vacations and healthcare for all citizens, not whether or not the Huffington Post is reliable or not. So, with that in mind, CMV.</selfText></submission>

<submission><id>23</id><identifier>4hkybb</identifier><title>CMV: Parents should always be responsible for adult children</title><commentCount>103</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4hkybb/cmv_parents_should_always_be_responsible_for/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>First let me preface this by saying I am happily living on my own and have been for well over a decade (I'm 35) and that my mom misses when I lived at home when I was an undergrad (18-22). She jokes I'm the only sane one in her life even though I live two thousand miles away (we visit each other when we can) and actually wishes I would move back in. 

But somehow it just absolutely rubs me the wrong way when I hear people say "the day my daughter turns 18, she's out!" or "my son is 20 and lost his job but he needs to work at mcdonalds and gtfo" 

The parents created the child, now an adult. And this is a very, very cruel miserable world. It's not all dark clouds but there is some insane awfulness. War, disease, death, destruction... as George Carlin once said. And I didn't ask to be born into this shit. I'm not suicidal or depressed (though I have been in the past), but that's a crippling condition that is not often understood. And there are even worse conditions. By virtue of my birth, my parents may be sentencing me to several fates worse than death...

So because I had no say in my birth, they should be responsible for me, if I need it. I will say that IF (big if) this offer is given, I think the adult child should be responsible for the parent if they are in trouble too, but that's a whole separate discussion I don't really want to get into.

Of course, I also don't mean the parent should be responsible for the adult child's actions (ie serve a jail sentence for them). I just mean if the adult child is having medical or financial problems, the parent should be responsible.

<submission><id>24</id><identifier>3gwou8</identifier><title>CMV: Sexual predators who prey upon minors should either be executed or kept in prison for life. No attempt at rehabilitating them for release back into society should be made.</title><commentCount>98</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3gwou8/cmv_sexual_predators_who_prey_upon_minors_should/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>This is a somewhat complex issue but I'll try to explain it and my views on what I think should be done.

Some people have an innate attraction towards children. This is sad. They can't act on it without harming someone. Some act on it and rape/molest children. This is also sad and horrible.

So we catch a child predator and put him in prison. As far as I know there is no law allowing for child predators to be put away for life. I know in some states the death penalty can be applied but isn't always carried out.

The child predator gets convicted and goes to prison for however long the sentence is.

There are those who say that people who prey upon children should be rehabilitated and released back into society. I am unaware of any programs that try to rehabilitate pedophiles and child predators. If they do exist and if they have succeeded at rehabilitating people, please tell me since I don't know much concerning that aspect of this debate.

So the child predator enters a program to make sure he doesn't re offend when he enters society. If he shows potential and meets the criteria for being released (Whatever the criteria may be) he gets released in the hopes he can become a productive citizen that doesn't harm children.

This is a good thing on its face, at least to some people. I DO believe that if we are to release people like those who have sex with or molest children, we should at least make the attempt to prevent them from doing it again.

I don't know how successful these programs have been at making sure child predators don't re offend. I don't know the percentage of success vs failure, as in what number of those in the program went on to molest or rape again compared to those that didn't.

However, I believe the margin of error is too great to take the chance to release these people back into society as opposed to keeping them in prison for life or executing them.

By margin of error I don't necessarily know that the percentage of those who will re offend is too high to be statistically feasible, I don't know what the exact statistics are concerning this. I would like to know however.

Let's say that for every child predator that becomes viable for release and is entered into a program designed to rehabilitate them so they don't rape or molest more kids as soon as they leave prison, that out of every 100, 1 or 5 or 10 will re offend and rape or molest AT LEAST 1 child.

I believe that even if the success rate is many times higher than the rate of failure, it is still too high to be  morally feasible or even ethical.

No system is perfect. Chances are that out of all the sex offenders who are "rehabilitated", at least some of them WILL go on to rape or molest more children. Knowing this, we shouldn't release them at all. We should either execute them or keep them in prison until they die of old age.

I value the well being of the victims and the potential victims more than I do that of the perpetrators. Even if a program was created so that 99% of all who enter it never harm a single child again, that 1% is far too high to be allowed to occur.

It isn't high statistically of course. But the human cost is too high. Money can be replaced. Property can be replaced or fixed. If you get beaten up your wounds will heal eventually. You can't heal from getting raped or molested as a child. From that point on your life is changed. You have to deal with those memories for the rest of your life. Your whole life will be a battle to overcome what happened to you. Mentally and emotionally an event as traumatizing as that can be damaging. You can become depressed or addicted to drugs. Living life as a rape victim is not pleasant at all. It's a nightmare. Especially at such a young age to be raped or molested.

If you support this idea, are you going to be able to look into the face of the friends and family of the innocent child/children that was raped or molested by someone who was supposed to be cured or fixed of his/her desire to fuck kids and tell them:

"I'm sorry your loved one was harmed and is now going to be traumatized for life and will have this horrific event in their mind indefinitely. I'm sorry but we had to release these people back into society and make sure they don't harm anymore children. Your case, though tragic, was simply a statistical error that we couldn't account for. Meanwhile we will continue to release people just like the person who raped your child in the hopes they don't re offend"

That's a really cold and fucked up thing to tell someone whose son or daughter was raped or molested. Telling the victim that their tragedy was the result of a 1% chance of failure or a 5% chance in a program designed to prevent children being harmed is just inconsiderate.

It seems like it values the perpetrators and ignores the victims. I value the life and well being of innocent children more than that of those could harm them.

It isn't moral to release 100 people with the knowledge that a small fraction of them will certainly cause more pain and suffering. 

I'm not saying that pedophiles and the like can't be rehabilitated. I'm saying that it isn't a 100% guarantee of success so we shouldn't release any of them, regardless of their chances. The margin of error (A child or children being raped or molested) is too high to be feasible or ethical/moral.

So I suggest either we create a program that can 100% guarantee that those in said program won't rape or molest again when they get freedom (Not likely at all with modern technology) or we keep them in prison for life. Or execute them. I'm fine with any of those options.

Any measure that prevents children from harm is necessary and ethical. Even if it means keeping convicted sex offenders in prison for the rest of their natural lives.

My view can be changed by proving that the pros of releasing child predators back into society after attempting to rehabilitate them is larger than the cons of children being molested or raped by someone who was "cured" or "rehabilitated."

You have to prove that it is worth it morally/ethically to rehabilitate sex offenders and release them back into society even if the chance that they will re offend again is not certain or consists of a small percentage (Lower than 10%)

Edit: Arguments should address whether or not the rehabilitation and release of sex offenders who prey upon children is feasible or ethical. Try to avoid slippery slope arguments because I'm **NOT** proposing that any other crime besides rape or molestation be punished with life in prison. I'm not saying we should put litterers and people who steal candy bars away for life. Don't attack arguments I haven't made by using the slippery slope fallacy.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>25</id><identifier>1yng8d</identifier><title>Police should be subject to additional criminal charges for "Violation of the Public Trust" when they are found to have acted outside of their appropriate legal authority. [CMV]</title><commentCount>93</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1yng8d/police_should_be_subject_to_additional_criminal/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I think we might need to institute a new criminal law called **"Violation of the Public Trust"** where a representative of the legal system can be charged with the additional crime of violating the trust and responsibility the public and the law itself expects from such officials by acting beyond the bounds of their legitimate authority. This would allow specific criminal charges in addition to the already available civil penalties a citizen might seek in compensation for false arrest, assault or death resulting from inappropriate police behavior. A conviction might allow or obligate a judge to increase the prison sentence or add community service for an offender. 

This criminal charge would bring such cases before an actual jury of citizens and allow them to review the evidence for themselves rather than having a single judge make a unilateral decision or a biased "internal review board" clear the cop behind closed doors. We need these cases heard in open court and subject to public scrutiny via the media. The current secrecy and "brotherhood" slap-on-the-wrist penalties do nothing to protect the public or achieve justice for the victims of police lies and brutality.

Currently, police are allowed more lee-way to use force under the assumption that they are acting in the public good. Even when this act is later shown to be improper, it is assumed they were acting in "good faith" and thus not subject to penalty.  Either citizens must equally be assumed to have acted in "good faith" in use of force against police and not subject to prosecution, or cops must be equally subject to criminal penaly when they overstep, regardless of whether they *believed* they were doing the right thing.

*****

Edit: although my view has not technically changed, some clarification is in order. I have asserted that there *should* be a law that specifically punishes "abuse of authority" and several respondents have said this already exists. I have called this "Violation of the Public Trust", but the existing law is [Section 242 of Title 18 - DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/242fin.php). This law should, and does, exist, but it may not go far enough nor include the full range of what the average person might consider an "abuse" of police power. Additionally, it appears that this law is under-used by timid prosecutors afraid of losing their political appointment and angering the police who can then make their job as a prosecutor difficult. Some other mode seems necessary to ensure accusations of abuse are handled fairly and openly.

One other point raised is that regular citizens can be arrested and charged on the word of an officer alone. An officers sworn affidavit of eyewitness is given more weight and is often sufficient to "prove" guilt (e.g. speeding being the most common, but also "resisting" arrest). This power is not available to average citizens when making accusations of police abuse. When a citizen makes an accusation it is treated as a mere "complaint" and then handled by "internal review" which most often finds no wrongdoing, even in cases where evidence was available that later clearly showed the complaint was true. 

My version of this law would force such complaints to be treated like any other criminal accusation and tried in open court like any other crime. This would take the power to determine guilt or innocence out from behind the closed doors of the precinct and put it in front of the public for a jury of citizens to judge for themselves. Perhaps a necessary feature would be to make prosecuting these cases compulsory so that DAs don't get the blame for bringing charges and avoid placing that strain on their relationship with the police. Having this separate charge would also allow juries to find the officer specifically guilty of only abusing their power, even if evidence was lacking to prove other criminal acts.

*****

Edit2: some have mentioned the existence of "Citizen Review Boards" as an argument against my idea. Here is one such example. Others also exist. 

[NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Complaint_Review_Board)

*"All cases sent to the Police Commissioner come with recommendation of discipline made by the Board, which the Commissioner has the privilege to review and enforce or overrule. In fact, if s/he so chooses, the Commissioner can essentially dismiss the complaint once he receives it."*

In other words, such bodies have no teeth. One additional option that should be available is to give these review boards the authority to pursue criminal charges, at least so far as to mandate a [Grand Jury](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury) be convened to look at the evidence and determine if an indictment is warranted.

*****

Edit3: some have also argued that, since police work is difficult, cops should receive significant protection in the course of acting as enforcers. My response:

*"Lest this post give the wrong impression, I will openly state here that I have tremendous respect for the very valuable job that Good Cops do, and I am very certian that the majority of cops* **are** *good and* **are** *acting appropriately, according to strict policy/procedure, and with only the best of intentions. I agree that better training is always good and I would encourage all departments to riase the minimum education requirement for an officer to a Masters in Criminal Justice or equivalent law degree.*

*"Our police should be the epitome of civility, intellect and physical prowess, not simply brutish thugs with a badge and a gun who excell only at following orders. I realize this is a VERY high standard, but I believe it is fully appropriate. If we are to give individuals such authority, we must demand that they be raised to this level of power and responsibility because they have proved they are worthy. Then we must expect them to demonstrate that worthiness on a daily basis in every official act.*

*"If you are one of these Good Cops, you should have nothing to fear from such a law as I propose, just as innocent citizens who have done no wrong should have nothing to fear from police who are acting within the bounds of their appropriate authority. It is improper to say that a cop's decisions should not be subject to a more strict review or the possibility of criminal prosecution simply because the job is difficult ("You don't know what it's like out there or what we have to deal with! you don't get to judge me!").*

*"Would you so broadly excuse the mistakes of a surgeon if their mistake resulted in your father's death simply because surgery is complicated? Would you accept the excuse, "You don't know what it's like! Don't judge me! You're not a surgeon!" if such was their defense for improper or criminal behavior? Many jobs are difficult and many tough decisions must be made. The difficulty of the job is no excuse for significant, or especially lethal, errors in judgement, let alone willful abuse of power."*

*****

Edit4: It seems to me that taking these decisions out of the hands of secret "internal review boards" and putting them on full display in court to be witnessed by the public and decided by a jury should have the intended effect of achieving justice for the victim and actual punishment for the offender as well as serving as a deterent to other officers who might take similar criminal action in violation of the public trust. I can't imagine this being a bad thing in any way. Why should we have one standard for citizens accused of a crime and another for police accused of a crime while on-duty? Are they to be treated as some "ruling class" above the law and favored with special treatment?

 I am accused of a crime and I am arrested, placed in jail, forced to pay bond if I wish to be free, taken to court and subject to prosecution by the full power of the state in collusion with the very arresting officer who made the claim that he witnessed me breaking the law in the first place.

An officer is accused of a crime and he gets put on paid leave while a closed-door, sealed-record "review" is conducted by fellow officers who typically dismiss the case or more rarely provide some impotent reprimand, after which the officer is back on the street free to continue such abuse at will.

How can such a thing even remotely be considered proper? How can this not be viewed as some "illuminati"-style double standard where those who enforce the law are themselves virtually immune to the law? Why would we not try these cases in open court rather than having some toothless parallel process that allows police to evade real justice?

*****

Edit5: question and answer from responses below...

&gt; "What governs the use of deadly force against unarmed civilians..."

&gt; *Everybody defines it differently, but more or less the standard is: If the police officer reasonably believes that the person represents a grave threat to them or others ("grave" meaning serious enough to possibly be fatal or near-fatal), they can use deadly force.*

My response...

"It would seem appropriate then that so long as a citizen reasonably felt they or others were at grave theat from an officer then that citizen should have the authority to use deadly force against that officer. And, as we must presume innocence, we should simply take the citizen's word for it and let the matter be. After all, the cop brought a weapon to a public place and this indicates a willingness if not outright intent to use it. We can simply convene a closed door council of the citizen's neighbors to hear his account and they can conclude he acted appropriately. Or, if he did not, he can be let go with a warning not to kill any more cops under similar circumstances. No more criminal charges for killing police. Actually, I rather like this plan.  Perhaps I will CMV after all."

You know that they will probably be charged, and you know the order of magnitude of punishment they will receive.

Take a scenario where you knowingly wrongfully accuse someone of murder, and they get the death penalty as a result. I would say that you *murdered* this person and therefore should be exposed to the death penalty yourself in trial. 

This seems to especially apply in cases of rape. While there are no doubt actual rapes that do occur. False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South, where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.

This tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and (this is what I believe, and not the subject of this post) Bill Cosby. 

A person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear, but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others.

I have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here.

**Rightful accusers would have something to fear, if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime, they will now face prosection**

This is a good point, but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process, regardless of the location of the trial, the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist, or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries, we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts.

**The punishment is harsher than the crime.**

No it isn't. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for 40 years is surely a capital offense, and should be punished as such.

**The perjury charge handles this**

I believe that this is too weak, it is not a capital offense, and it should be.

I am willing to change this view, but it will take some level of convincing. I am eager to hear the responses.  

MODIFICATION OF MY VIEW credit to /u/AMereRedditor:

I now believe that the minimum sentence for the crime that the accuser was accused of is inappropriate, but that the maximum sentence for the attempted version of the same crime is still very much appropriate. (If you are found guilty of knowingly, wrongfully accusing someone of murder, your sentence should be the maximum for attempted murder)

People say it's to keep criminals from the rest of society. Then why should we imprison them when we have other options to do that. In my opinion, it is immoral to imprison people and deny them a future. People advocate abolishing death penalty because it is wrong to kill people. Guess what, you're still kill them with imprisonment. You're killing them with time, and worst, instead of a quick death, they are tortured mentally and abused physically every single day. What else? Ah yes, the prisoners can be let out if they are found innocent later?!! But when you go in jail at 18 and get cleared at 50, your life is over. With no jobs, no skills, no relationships, no matter how much money you get for compensation, it won't bring back all the youth that you lost. You'll be pretty much sitting on these money waiting for the day you die. That is even more brutal than death penalty. I hardly can call that a progressive thing.

Therefore, I propose an alternative, better solution. We should build a segregated, walled town somewhere far from the population, like in a closed valley or on an island. Then we transport all the criminals there and provide them the basic necessities for life. We can then let them form their own society and grow their own town, having their own jobs, entertainment and social life  and even elect their own government (under heavy supervision and regulation of course). With this, we can accomplish everything we build prisons for without inhumanely torturing and abusing the inmates. They are kept away from normal society, we can actually see if they are actually reformed or not by observing their behaviors in that segregated community, and innocent inmates would still be able to enjoy a normal life like they would have in the normal society until they are set free. And it would be **much** more easy for prisoners to go back into society after their sentences (I think some of them wouldn't even leave after doing their time) because they haven't been suppressed socially and mentally for years. What's more? That town's activities and work can even generate profits and taxes for the country. It's a win-win situation, both morally, ethically and economically. Why didn't we do this in the first place?</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>28</id><identifier>2vsvys</identifier><title>CMV: Capital Punishment should be abolished in the United States</title><commentCount>78</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2vsvys/cmv_capital_punishment_should_be_abolished_in_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>The death penalty is an archaic, immoral, and cruel form of punishment. Yet, capital punishment is still a legal practice in 32 U.S. States, and has been used to kill over 1,200 accused criminals since 1977. A fundamental topic that must be assessed when judging the usage of the death penalty is the morality of the practice. Ultimately, the moral question encompassing the practice of capital punishment has less to do with whether those convicted of heinous crimes deserve to die than with whether the government deserves to kill those who it has imprisoned. The government does not have the right nor moral justification to execute criminals. The greatest achievement that comes from the usage of the death penalty is retribution, an achievement that compromises the core of our criminal justice system, which is a system meant to be used primarily for rehabilitation. To kill the person who has killed someone close to you is simply to continue the cycle of violence which ultimately destroys the avenger as well as the offender.

When looking at the statistics of capital punishment, one concept becomes clear: those without the capital, get the punishment. Capital punishment perpetuates social injustices by disproportionately targeting people of color and people who cannot afford good attorneys. The rich simply do not get the death penalty, which is why you’ll never see a person like O.J. Simpson sitting on death row. Death sentences are imposed in a criminal justice system that treats you better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent.

However, unlike other sentences which leave room for absolution for those who can prove their innocence at a later date, death is unusually severe in its finality. Once it is taken, a life cannot be given back. The finality and enormity involved with the punishment of death are particularly important to take into consideration when looking at the errors that are made in the conviction of innocent people in the criminal justice system. Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent. That is a demonstrated error rate of 1 innocent person for every 7 persons executed. An error percentage of this size may not be significant in some cases, however, in the case of capital punishment, where the consequences are matter of life and death, such mistakes cannot be taken lightly. 

The only way to ensure no error is made and innocent people are not killed is by not allowing the practice of capital punishment to occur in the first place.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>29</id><identifier>2k19cr</identifier><title>CMV: When one accepts that eating meat is immoral, one would also have to accept that wild animals that naturally eat meat either need to be "rehabilitated", or put down.</title><commentCount>75</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2k19cr/cmv_when_one_accepts_that_eating_meat_is_immoral/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>This is almost a tongue-in-cheek CMV, but the argument still feels like it has a little bit of truth to me. Help me sort this out, would ya?

"Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)"

I would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to "know better". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is "natural" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.

Of course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.

The only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.

Maybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Not that it was really coming up in discussion so far or anything, but I did want to mention that I am pescatarian, and also support vegetarianism and veganism. Just a bit of (possibly unnecessary) background on me, if anything.

**EDIT 2:** This might be a clearer explanation of my view:

Let's just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.

This may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.

**Final EDIT:** I think I am fairly satisfied with how this CMV turned out. Thanks for all your replies! It was simply a strange thought that I felt would be fun to try to argue about, but the CMV yielded some interesting conversations, at least for me. Thanks again!

In school we learned that there are 4 "reasons" we might send someone to prison. Retribution, Isolation, Rehabilitation, Deterrance. I think Isolation is the only valid reason.

* Retribution because obviously wrongdoers deserve to be punished, yes? I don't buy this because I think the justice system can't sink to the level of a criminal. It's hypocritical if sentencing laws sanction wrong action to be taken against a criminal because they've done wrong. Two wrongs making a right in the justice system undermines the whole idea of right and wrong and it would be better on principle if the justice system led by example. It's a justice system, not a revenge system.
* Deterrence because obviously, people who would become criminals might not want to be sent to prison, and so might modify their behaviour so that they are not sent to prison. This argument, while it makes sense, is not empirically true. States in the US with the death penalty have just as high murder rates as States without it. This is because a lot of crimes are committed opportunistically or in the heat of the moment: the majority of people don't think rationally through the consequences before they commit a crime.
* Rehabilitation - because in prison a criminal learns discipline and can learn from his mistakes. This is also not empirically true. Prisons can form "colleges of crime" where minor offenders come out of prison worse than when they went in because they learn from more serious offenders how best to commit crime. Reoffending rates of prison sentences are much higher than that of community service orders and a lot of criminals even prefer the routine of prison compared to the instability that exists in many of their home lives on the outside.

Lastly, prison is extremely costly and overcrowded. In the UK, it costs nearly £40,000 pounds (more than a whole year's salary for a lot of people) to incarcerate them. In addition, the prisons are overcrowded, but when you consider that 66% of the prison population is only there for 6 months or less for minor offences, it makes more sense to use alternatives to prison such as community service. They are cheaper, and reduce re offending more. CMV

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**EDIT:** So in the course of debate a number of things have come up. The first point is that without prison, because of the lack of a deterrent/retributive punishment two things will happen. Crime will increase because people don't mind getting caught and that the families of victims, unhappy with a lack of righteous punishment, will take the law into their own hands and dish out their own brand of less righteous punishment. So that everyone is up to speed, my answers have been that there is no excuse for vigilanteism and people must respect the rule of law. If they can't abide by this and they break the law they pose a threat to society and should therefore be jailed to isolate them. This isn't by any means the only solution, but is the first one I thought of.

The second point is that Community service is a "cop-out" punishment that will breed resentment towards the judicial system. I need to clarify a few things here. Community service is by no means the only alternative to a custodial sentence. Probation, a suspended sentence, tagging, curfews, generalised restrictions of liberty and "restorative justice" (a sentence that is used especially in cases of young offenders where they have to talk to their victims and in so doing learn the true consequences of their actions) are all available to the courts. I am assuming that the courts would choose an appropriate variety of these for the same length of time as the comparable prison sentence, just as they current choose an appropriate sentence under the current system.</selfText></submission>

CMV</title><commentCount>66</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1xf9jf/i_believe_it_is_unjustifiable_to_support_abortion/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>To be clear, I'm referring to both in a vacuum and as ideals. That is, I mean the idea of the death penalty as the harshest possible sentence for a capital crime in a world where the person sentenced to death is always guilty of the accused crime. I acknowledge that the death penalty in our actual world is highly flawed, but I do not believe this is because of the idea itself. Rather, I believe the flaws of the system are a result of human error, which means they are correctable. 

Likewise, I'm referring to abortion in the sense of a safe, professional environment (in other words, no home/amateur abortions). 

I think that abortion, regardless of when performed, robs a potential human being of its life. Whether you think that a fetus is a human being or not, it is a living mass of tissue that, without intervention, would become a human being with all of the possibilities of happiness and life that we all have. Furthermore, a fetus is innocent of any crime or action that would make it deserve death. Abortion is done for two reasons: either the Mother doesn't want the child or she can't safely have the child. In either case, the child is not at fault (I don't think you can blame developmental/delivery complications on the fetus). 

The death penalty is a punishment for something that a society has deemed crosses a very specific line (like murder). In the case of a death sentence (again, in an ideal), the victim has done something to warrant the sentence. They have broken the rules of the society they live in so severely that they cannot be allowed to have any further part of that society. 

By supporting abortion, but not the death penalty, I think someone is justifying one denial of life but not the other.</selfText></submission>

The charges against her are criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. These charges are considered more severe because they resulted in death. Dangerous driving in which no injury occurs [has a maximum sentence of 5 years](http://www.defencelaw.com/penalty-driving.html) while dangerous driving causing death has a maximum sentence of 14 years (from the first link).

However, from the perspective of the person committing the crime, there is no difference between these two circumstances. If nobody happened to drive into the car of the woman in the news story, she would be facing less serious charges. Yet, for the exact same actions (on her part), she's facing very serious charges simply because people died.

I don't see why causing injury or death makes a crime more or less severe when the intent is unchanged. Obviously the intent will affect the sentencing of this woman, but why should the charges be any different?

A similar argument can be made about drunk driving. Driving drunk is a serious crime. Yet, (in my province, for example) a first time drunk driver will typically face a fine and driving suspension. If they an unlucky person happens to cross the street in front of this driver, they could instead be looking at up to life time imprisonment. In each case, the drunk driver made the same, reckless choice of driving drunk, but an accidental death (which could just as easily happen to anyone who drives drunk) makes one situation worse (in terms of criminal charges).

So why should some people get off easily (or get punished more severely) because of accidental deaths that occurred when they committed a crime?

EDIT: To elaborate on my exact views, I believe that the woman in this case should be charged with some type of dangerous driving charge and that drunk driving should be punished more severely, as it is an easily preventable decision that has a greatly increased chance of killing or injuring someone (to the point that I'd argue that getting behind the wheel while drunk is akin to considering killing people).

This means about 85% of men in the general population are taller than me, but in the field I'm studying to be in (medicine/surgery) the average height is higher, meaning probably around 90%+ men are taller than me. (I assume this is similar to how CEOs are vastly overrepresented by men 6 foot plus.)

The procedure would be done by one of the best surgeons in the world, and would cost anywhere from 60-80k USD, but my family is well off financially and money would not be an issue. I am in my early 20s, so the benefit of the increased height would last me my life. I am currently taking some time off from school, so I would not be losing income or missing work anyway (the procedure from start to recovery would probably take 6-8 months). 

My two main reasons for wanting this procedure are:
 (1) increasing career success (many studies show that increased height is directly correlated  with increased salary, about $750 per inch). Increased height also leads to promotions and better job opportunities - this is not a figment of my imagination, in fact in China there are still height requirements for jobs like diplomats and lawyers.
 (2) increasing romantic success. Again, many studies show the critical importance of height for men, with 96% of women saying they would not date someone shorter, and online dating studies showing "...that a 5-foot-8 man was just as successful in getting dates as a 6-footer if he made more money — precisely $146,000 a year more. For a 5-foot-2 man, the number was $277,000."

I am also aware of the negative effect of being Asian on dating in the USA. Look at OkCupid studies on race (Asian males have the lowest reply rates even after controlling for income and age), and another study showing "For equal success with a white woman, an African-American needs to earn an additional $154,000; a Hispanic man needs $77,000; an Asian needs $247,000." - (the effect was found in every race and not just white women, I just didn't want to list everything). I seriously feel that being short AND asian is a death sentence to dating attractive women in the USA. If limb lengthening opens up a much greater pool of women, wouldn't it be worth the pain and chance of complication to actually be content in life / find love?

I am aware of the risks, but it seems that using internal methods with the best doctors is not as dangerous as people make it out to be. 

Arguments I would love to hear: logical arguments, arguments based on statistics or other data, pointing out things I haven't thought of, etc.
Arguments that would not help: "I have a friend who is a 5 foot guy who is a millionaire CEO" (I am not interested in anecdotes of outliers).  Or, "Who needs a woman who just likes you for your height? I know a woman whose husband is shorter" Again, just about all women find height attractive, and the data does not lie.

<submission><id>35</id><identifier>1hmnyg</identifier><title>I believe all drugs should be legalized (revised). CMV</title><commentCount>62</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1hmnyg/i_believe_all_drugs_should_be_legalized_revised/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>This time, I'm going to provide more arguments and explain the proposition more thoroughly.
 
1. How it would work:

So the distribution of drugs would go like this: There would be government stores, which would distribute and control the drugs. You'd have to be over 18 (or 21) to buy drugs, and you'd have to take a simple test on the effects of drugs to the human body, and if you pass that test, you're free to buy as much drugs as you want. 

2.The arguments to support this:

-In a free society, you must have the right to put to your own body whatever you want, otherwise it's not a free society at all.

-The quality of the drugs would be more pure due to the regulations and the government labs in which the drugs would be made so possible poisoning from fake/dirty/contaminated drugs would drop.

-The drugs would be heavily taxed, so the government would be able to make som money to pay of the HUGE FUCKING DEPT. And it would still be cheaper than the street market, because no high risk gang dealing is involved.

-Alcohol is legal, and many drugs like marihuana or LSD are far more harmless to the human body than alcohol. So why would alcohol be legal but LSD illegal?

-This way the gang drug wars would stop, drug related deaths and prison sentences would go down, it would be cheaper for the society.

While a lot of the arguments for it ("It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that "Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because "Desperate people might feel obligated to work them", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions ("Massage parlors"). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments ("Selling your body is wrong", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions ("Women will be forced into sex slavery")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

<submission><id>37</id><identifier>2n1hpm</identifier><title>CMV: A characteristic of a sophisticated justice system is that it be as "outcome-independent" as possible</title><commentCount>61</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2n1hpm/cmv_a_characteristic_of_a_sophisticated_justice/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>The punishment should fit the crime, not the outcome of the crime.

This was inspired this post on the front page: [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2mzuxe/father_throws_chair_at_judge_after_the_driver/)

The judge sentences a driver to 120 hours of community service for running into a family and killing 3 people, and the father, whom I can't even imagine the sorrow and anguish he is going through, throws a chair at the judge. The driver was known to be going 40 km/hr over the limit. I hope the judge and security guards were sympathetic to the extreme emotions and sorrow in the father's head, and the punishment to him, if any, is minimal.

Regardless, and I don't feel that I'm being insensitive: I believe the judge's sentence was reasonable. The crime was "driving 40 km/hr over the limit". The outcome of the crime was people died. The outcome of the crime should not affect the verdict. **If you say "the driver should be put in jail for *blank* years!" it's very reasonable to say that anyone caught going 40 km/hr over the limit should also be put in jail for *blank* years. They just got lucky and didn't drive into anyone; the crime is identical.** To do otherwise is to make the legal system more about vengeance than keeping society under control.

Another example: ever seen A Clockwork Orange? Alex, the main character, beat a lady very severely. He was arrested, and the police wanted to charge him with assault, which was a relatively common and minor charge in the hyper-violent society. It wasn't until she died that he was really in trouble with the law, and the cops told him this. In my opinion, Alex should have had one charge/punishment against him the whole time: "assault and battery with a strong possibility of causing death" (which is a theoretical crime I just made up) and he should have been convicted of it regardless of if the lady died.

You couldn't make it "perfect" so that every single crime is as outcome-independent as possible, especially because some crimes aren't even apparent until the outcome happens. However, I still think outcome-independence is a desirable aspect of a sophisticated legal system and something to strive for as much as possible.

**EDIT:**  I feel that everyone is arguing that what I'm suggesting would cause drastic changes in the legal system, but I don't really feel that it would. Here's some of the changes that would be made by attempting to be more outcome independent:

Here are some theoretical punishments in a modern justice system:

* Murder: 25 years

* Attempted murder: 15 years

* Firing a gun straight up into the air causing death (involuntary manslaughter): 5 years

* Firing a gun straight up into the air not causing death: Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.

Here's how a "outcome-independent" legal system would treat things:

* Murder: 25 years

* Attempted murder: 25 years

* Firing a gun straight up into the air causing death (involuntary manslaughter): Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.

* Firing a gun straight up into the air not causing death: Community service. Perhaps brief jail time.

They're simply too smart, too powerful, and often too unorthodox for the police to effectively deal with them. It takes someone of superior ability and freedom to catch these villains.

A few arguments I'm anticipating:

**Super villains wouldn't exist unless Batman provoked their creation of a secret identity**

Perhaps, but I think it's reasonable to say many of them would have at least become criminals, abate less theme oriented. And many, like Mr. Freeze or Hush, had very specific events trigger them and I feel they would probably have done exactly what they did either way. This is all speculation however, my concrete refutation of this point is that there are hundreds of costumed vigilantes in the DC universe and if Batman didn't inspire them to take up a secret identity, someone else would have. Or, super villains from other places would target Gotham because it has no super hero protecting it.

**Batman isn't effective, the villains just go to jail and then escape the next night**

I've never understood why Batman catches the flack for this one. Batman cannot sentence them to the death penalty. I suppose you could say he ought to be killing them himself, but even just catching the villains over and over is more good than the police are doing, which is nothing. I don't think there's a single comic where the police are able to stop Joker all by themselves. They're helpless against these super villains, Batman is the only thing that can combat them. Even if he doesn't do it efficiently, he still does it to some degree.

Yet there are several victimless acts where the punishment can be either decades in jail or exorbitant fines, which seems very excessive and pointless to me. An act which does not negatively affect another person is inherently less harmful than an act that does negatively affect another person. Not sure if I can explain this any further, so I'll just list some examples of victimless crimes:

Sodomy - probably the easiest example to agree with. Sodomy is the "crime" of unnatural sex acts, and is largely synonymous with homosexual sex as far as relevance goes. While legal today, historically the punishment for sodomy has been DEATH. In many parts of the world this is still the case, and even in America, Sodomy was punishable by death (but usually long imprisonment or hard labor). Ironically enough Russia was the first nation to officially legalize homosexuality about 100 years ago.

Drug possession - sentences vary from state to state, but due to mandatory minimum sentencing laws many end up serving over 10 years for possession of "hard" drugs like crack or heroin. You could argue that having enough to distribute makes someone harmful to society, but just enough for personal use?

Piracy - punishment for this is rare, but when it gets punished, the punishment is incredibly oppressive. A [$220,000 fine for downloading 24 songs](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/03/18/supreme-court-upholds-220000-fine-for-music-piracy/) serves absolutely no purpose and is downright cruel. Even something like "pay 10x the price of these songs" would be fine in comparison. 

I'm wondering how this stuff even makes sense from a legal perspective, and I can think of no punishment theories that would justify such punishment. They go overboard from the perspectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and certainly retribution. </selfText></submission>

CMV.</title><commentCount>53</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1t657y/i_believe_that_life_in_prison_without_the/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Whenever debating over the death penalty this viewpoint never seems to be brought up,  usually everyone assumes the death penalty to be the worst punishment possible.  I however think that life in prison without the possibility of parole is worse.  

Why I think this:

● Prison is a pretty bad place to be.  I've never heard anyone say they liked prison and most well tell you how awful it is.  The legal system is based on the idea that a longer prison sentence means a worse punishment,  thus a life sentence is worse than anything less. 

●If you get life in prison you're going to die in prison, which has the same end result as the death penalty. 

●The death penalty is a painless way to be killed (I realize 
there are reports that it is painful but it's claimed to be painless so for simplicity lets assume it is painless) where as many natural deaths may not be painless. 

Ultimately it seems like the death penalty is a way to get a shorter prison sentence and guarantee a painless death, thus making it a less harsh sentence than life in prison.  CMV.</selfText></submission>

This is an absurd waste of resources.  For one, depending on the age of the criminal, the state is going to be keeping him/her alive in prison for at least 10 years and in some cases upwards of 50.  For another, this is giving them the opportunity to break out and cause more havoc than they already have.  I'm grossly overestimating prison escape statistics but the fact of the matter is that if they break out more and more people will be hurt because of their actions.  There is, from my perspective, no reason to let a person who has a life sentence in jail to live, as it only wastes money, prison space, and the time of everyone involved.  Change my view.

I believe prison should be used to rehabilitate individuals so that they may return to society. I don't understand why locking someone up for life is beneficial to anyone. Let's say someone steals your car. I think they should be given a jail sentence that would provide enough time for that person to recognize what they did is wrong and hopefully be able to come out of jail as a better person. (I also think we would need better ways of releasing individuals into the public. Lots of people dont have the means to come out of jail and stabilize their life.) 

If someone does a crime so atrocious that society deems them unable to return from it, then I believe the death penalty is justified. I don't agree that people should be locked up until they die. 1) It doesn't help them. 2) It's really expensive.

CMV.</title><commentCount>51</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1xsyus/i_believe_macs_are_great_computers_for_their/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Yes you pay a bit of a premium, but you get what you pay for. I'm a technical user but only order Macs for the following reasons.

1. **Mac OS X**. It's much simpler than Windows 7 and 8 and I just prefer it for an OS because I've found it to be more reliable. Yes, I realize you can run OS X through a Hackintosh PC, but it's never as reliable as Mac computers, plus you can't really update reliably. Or at least it wasn't several years ago, I don't know about now. Plus it seems to be more efficient. I'm typing this on a 4 year old late 2008 MacBook Pro. It still feels as fast as the day I got it. Meanwhile, my Windows performance has slowed down.

2. **Customer service**. You order a Windows PC from Best Buy and when you go in to get it serviced, they tell you to fuck off or charge you an absurd fee. They even charge you to look at your computer. Apple has great customer service. Not only are they great at replacing things under warranty, but they check out your computer free of charge even if it's out of warranty. Recently, my motherboard failed. On any other computer, it would have been a death sentence, but Apple offered to refurbish it for $300. Not only did they replace my motherboard, but they replaced my keyboard that had a few loose keys, my faulty disc drive, my battery, my RAM, a dent in the body (I did have to hassle them for this bc they wanted to charge me extra and wouldn't fix anything without fixing the dent), and my trackpad for the same price.

3. **Build quality**. I'm not a fan of the plastic design of many computers nowadays. I love the unibody design, it just feels solid.

4. **Accessories/Parts**. It's easy to order replacement parts and accessories for a Mac. I easily found a new AC adapter and a new battery through Amazon. Meanwhile, it was a nightmare trying to find a decent AC adapter for my older Toshiba laptop. One of the ones I ordered almost caught on fire when I tried to plug in an S-Video cable.

5. **Processing power**. The Macs on the market now has as much, if not more, processing power than the top of the line PC's out now. Yes you pay a premium, but you gain the other benefits I mentioned above.

6. **Reliability** *Knock on wood*, I've had fewer issues with this computer than any other computer I've had. Like I said, really the only issue in 4 years is a motherboard failure, which is pretty good considering it's used constantly and carried around in a backpack.

And if you search around or order from the refurb store (which I tend to do), you pay even less of a premium. Look [here](http://store.apple.com/us/product/FD103LL/A). This is a 2 year old model, but it's still as powerful as many new laptops for a significant discount and all the benefits I mentioned above. 

By all means, prove me wrong and change my view, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.</selfText></submission>

I believe this would reduce the amount of these types of crimes committed if the offenders knew the consequences before they ever committed the crime. This would also cost millions of dollars less per year to house criminals given life sentences in prison. </selfText></submission>

A majority of criminologists believe that the death penalty used as such is not a deterrent to violent crime.  See, e.g. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-about-deterrence-and-death-penalty.  I agree, the death penalty, used as such, is merely retributive.  The idea being that one who commit a purposeful, heinous murder should have purposeful killing visited on him.  

But where some would call for halting the death penalty in light of its impotence, my view is that it should be expanded to other, lesser offenses on which it will have a deterrent effect.  Some things to which I would make it applicable: (1) trafficking in narcotics (other than marijuana), (2) membership in a documented criminal street gang (MS-13, Mara 18, Bloods, Crips, etc.) (3) attempted murder, (4) child sexual abuse, (5) an assault of one inmate on another inmate in prison, (6) felon in possession of a firearm, (7) armed robbery, (8) political corruption, (9) unprovoked assault on the elderly or inform, and (10) forcible rape under aggravating circumstances.

While this may seem barbaric, I find cancerous street violence and aberrant behavior more offensive.  I would prefer a world where any person can walk down any street in any part of his country, without fear of assault or harassment.  I think that gangs would become markedly less attractive for young people if they knew that their involvement in them would make them amenable to a death sentence.  I can envision a country without crime in a generation if such policy is adopted.  

Regarding inmate violence, it sounds inhumane, But consider the inhumanity of prison today.  Racial violence is rampant, one may be forced to join groups for protection, and may be required to perform acts of violence on behalf of that group.  "Snitches" must serve out their entire sentences in solitary confinement or risk murder.  Men are subject to sexual assault by other men.  Criminal gangs lead empires from behind bars.  That's no way to run an orderly prison, and the most efficient way to fix the problem is to simply kill the malcontents after a trial.

There is, of course,  the issue of wrongful convictions.  But, as technology progresses, convictions will become more, rather than less, accurate.  I would also be amenable to a new legal standard for imposition of the death penalty in the cases I've described.  We have "beyond a reasonable doubt" now.  There's no reason we can't move to "beyond a shadow of a doubt" supported by videographic or DNA evidence in order to impose the highest sentence.

It's plainly apparent to me that our system allows cancerous criminal organizations to corrupt our society, we can stop them if we have the fortitude to endure the pain of cutting them out.  Change my view.



EDIT - I am sufficiently convinced that we haven't yet reached a level of certainty in criminal conviction - especially based on arguments that forensics and DNA evidence are not as reliable as I'd thought.  Thanks for the discussion.

1) Refusing blood transfusion isn't always a death sentence. 

Yes, but the refusal is not conditioned upon whether death is imminent or not. And in many cases - it is. 

2) One of them is an active action, while the other is passive.

I am unconvinced that this is important.

Something else?

At it's core - I was under the impression that this was a self determination issue - and in this case I don't see why the two should be treated differently?

I picked Jehovah's witness because it is the case in medical ethics I hear most about. 

Acknowledging that there doesn't exist an imperative to prevent death - why should we not allow people the right to die - passive or active. 

A closer example might be DNR - but CPR has a low success rate.

Is there a real difference between not administering a procedure which will most definitely save someone's life on their request and administering a treatment to end their life?

Please do not focus on the Jehovah's witness aspect of this CMV.

Edit: I'll be back in 12 hours. I know that there is a technical difference between passive and active action, but why is it morally relevant in this case?

<submission><id>49</id><identifier>2uc0t7</identifier><title>CMV: I would have no problem if the death penalty was reintroduced in a limited capacity to the UK.</title><commentCount>41</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2uc0t7/cmv_i_would_have_no_problem_if_the_death_penalty/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText> It was only 60 or so years ago that the UK actually did have the death penalty for crimes such as murder, as well as treason (a law which wasn't changed until the 1990s, even though the death penalty was abolished in 1965) and some other offences. 

  I would have little problem in having the option of sentencing someone to death by hanging (which was the standard method used in this country) as an option for judges in sentencing offenders who have committed particularly brutal murders or treason. The strict criteria of this only being an option for the worst crimes would ensure that it would not be overused or seen as a 'normal' punishment but a last resort where it is clear that typical sentencing would not be enough. The limited scope of such a sentence would also serve to place a responsibility on the judge to justify such a sentence given it is intended to be scarce in use, ensuring that there is accountability. 

 Also, I would argue that hanging is a humane method by which someone can die- assuming the old method with the long drop through the trapdoor is used, my reading tells me that typically a person will die almost instantly from a fractured neck. The hangmen such as Albert Pierrepoint were highly skilled in being able to judge the exact drop and length of rope needed for a person's height and weight. I believe (although I could be wrong) that there exists at least one prison in the UK which still has a working gallows as well as its original condemned cells. I am sure that given resources and time, such facilities could be easily re-established at a fairly low cost. 
 
  It must be said that Japan has a similar system where the death penalty is still an option and hanging the usual method used, which seems to work well. 

  So can anyone change my mind?

Would their victims pardon them? Is there actually a chance that they can still be a productive member of society? 

I am aware that certain circumstances can show that a person did a terrible thing through systematically making bad decisions; im asking about those who have chosen to destroy another persons life as they know it in a way that kills them, or harms them in a life altering way with no remorse or hate.

Edit: Ok... to clarify: im referring to cases where the person has a past history of aggresion (a criminal record) and has proved themselves to not be a productive member of society.

Boxing and other personal combat sports emphasize violently defeating your opponent, as opposed to other sports, which are not primarily violent, although many are violent in their execution.  My objection is only secondarily about the us vs. them mentality, which is a feature in varying degrees of all sports, but one that I don't think is as destructive as the deliberate, direct romanticization of violence found in personal combat sports.  My main objection is to using terms and ideas such as "heart," "commitment," "(personal) struggle," and "accomplishment" in reference to beating the everloving hell out of someone.  In media, of course, these things are used as justification for the violence, as is, frequently, any of a number of ways to vilify the opponent.

Arguments I have considered and find unpersuasive:  
* *Some participants, Muhammed Ali high among them, contribute to society in areas unrelated to their sport.*  This is orthogonal to my CMV, as it reduces to an argument of justification, which implies that something needs to be justified rather than is acceptable in its own right.  Whether participation in personal combat is justified by other activities is a separate issue, and likely highly dependent on the individual being considered.  
* *Boxing provides a way for the disadvantaged and/or disaffected to feel pride, accomplishment, and many of the other qualities commonly attached to boxing.*  So do gangs and the military.  So does learning a productive craft, or a more team-oriented and less inherently violent sport.  Boxing, and portraying it in a positive light, has the additional, major, and negative aspect of promoting violence, which makes it inferior to everything in the preceding sentence.  
* *Boxing is no different in essence from other sports that may be detrimental to society, including martial arts.* In general, I do agree that our societal obsession with sports is at the very least a waste of resources, including time, money, and attention.  However, boxing and other personal combat sports have the definitional difference that the very purpose, or goal, of the game is to inflict violence, which sets them apart.  More traditional martial arts competitions are, in my view, a more middle ground; I am less condemnatory of them both because they don't have the popularity necessary to do societal damage, because they emphasize competition and mastery of technique much more than sheer violence (I don't believe a knock-out is ever a primary goal, for example), and because the historical and philosophical aspects are comparatively more pronounced.  More generally, I see a continuum that looks **something like** Golf-Tennis--------------------Football----Hockey-------Martial Arts-----------------------------------------Boxing-------MMA

<submission><id>53</id><identifier>3k7dkg</identifier><title>CMV: Watching A Video Of Actual Murder/Severe Torture(Besides for investigation Purposes) Should Be Illegal And Punishable With Lengthy Prison Sentences</title><commentCount>40</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3k7dkg/cmv_watching_a_video_of_actual_murdersevere/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Note: This would only apply to REAL murders. Murders in fiction like videogames, literature, movies, etc would still be legal to watch.

ISIS is putting out a lot of videos of beheadings and other forms of murder/torture for attention. A lot of the videos being put out go viral, giving them exactly what they desire- exposure and attention.

In a lot of ways, it's effects are much similar to Child pornography, except far worse:

-these videos are being created not only for the purpose of distribution, but also as tools to incite future crime, by encouraging others to do similar things or join their extremist group.

-CP in its worst form(rape) is probably created for much similar purposes- the event likely had additional influencial factors(ISIS is hateful of a particular individual, pedo has lust), but the ability to record it and distribute it may have created additional motivation to carry out the terrible act(ISIS wants exposure, pedo might want to brag on anonymous underground site or something).

possession of CP, in its worst form, is roughly equivalent in negative effects to watching ISIS beheading videos, assuming the content is not paid for. If paid for, then CP possession becomes worse, because then it is being directly funded. I'm not a pedo, but I'm willing to assume most pedos don't pay for that shit. Most people don't even pay for (legal) porn, I seriously doubt pedos pay for CP when it leaves a paper trail that can get them caught, and when it's supposedly readily available at underground sites(once again, I have no clue where they find it and no desire to know)

However, CP in milder forms, such as fictional drawings, or consensual nudity/sexting, has far less negative effects, yet is illegal, while murder videos remain legal despite their distribution having severe effects on society.

By making murder/torture videos illegal, you:

-Reduce the spread and exposure of viral murder videos on sites like Liveleak, by creating fear of prosecution, and preventing sites from legally hosting it. 

-Reduces the ability for ISIS and other potential hate/extremist groups to gain exposure/attract potential recruits by weakening their ability to put out violent content.

-Protects the victims as well. Some victims may not want their deaths being viewed by millions of people. It's disrespectful to the dead and the concept of knowing your demise will be viewed worldwide will cause even further emotional suffering up until the point of death.

My point is, the widespread distribution and consumption of videos of actual murder has similar effects to the most severe form of CP,  and therefore should not be legal either if the same logic is used as what is used to make CP illegal. Both have negative effects on society and neither should be legal.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>54</id><identifier>4h00ox</identifier><title>CMV: When the U.S., U.N. or any Western leader "strongly denounces" ("condemns", etc.) a violent act in the world, it is a meaningless sentiment.</title><commentCount>41</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4h00ox/cmv_when_the_us_un_or_any_western_leader_strongly/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>**The cycle:**

An atheist blogger is hacked to death in Myanmar... a suicide bomber goes off at a wedding in Pakistan... North Korea sentences a foreigner to hard labor...

World leaders go on TV and condemn the violent act ([Paris attacks, for example)](http://www.firstpost.com/world/attack-on-all-of-humanity-us-joins-canada-germany-uk-in-condemning-paris-attacks-2506148.html). 

First off, *duh*. Of course we condemn it. Do world leaders think if they don't say anything it means we "support" it?

Further, it seems like little if any further action is taken (maybe only publicly, perhaps, but "Kony 2012", "Bring Back Our Girls", etc?), and these condemnations get more and more hollow.

EDIT: I'm close to being, if not already at, level delta. I've taken some notes that I need to address and I promise I'll come back and award deltas to those who helped delta me as soon as I can. Standby. And thanks to everyone who commented. I feel a little better about perceivably arbitrary foreign relations.

EDIT 2: As promised, got some ∆s to distribute. I see the answer as two-fold: First, as to why leaders **should say something**, /u/Virtuallyalive mentioned how, more importantly than how it affects me sitting on my couch, those, say, in Aleppo, might be inspired by Obama saying "we see your plight". Further, /u/5555512369874 explained how the tier of influence of the person making the statement impacts the intensity of that statement. Second, as to why leaders **should not-not say something**, /u/nohidden made it pretty clear with the implications made when Donald Drumpf *didn't* respond to the comment from his KKK supporter *implied his support* whether accurate or not. In summary, as /u/garnteller said first, "foreign policy is very complex." Thanks everyone at CMV... What a cool system!

<submission><id>55</id><identifier>4qtg2o</identifier><title>CMV: All drugs should be legal</title><commentCount>43</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4qtg2o/cmv_all_drugs_should_be_legal/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I will start by saying that I fin altering your mental state through chemicals to be destructive and stupid, and have never used them myself, but I am nothing if not an advocate of freedom and choice, and drug usage is a personal decision which I find in no way immoral. With that said, I can see no way in which the current laws on drugs are not universally harmful to both the individual and society at large. The entire concept of the war on drugs seems to resolve around the governing body ruling them immoral based on subjective morality, a false sense of protection and large business that profits from their illegal status.


Perhaps my biggest problem with illegal drugs is the legalization of alcohol. Alcohol, a dangerous and addictive drug which results in many deaths both to the drinker and those around them, is completely legal and only very lightly restricted in any way. For me, the arguments of immorality and safety concerns of any other drug become incredibly hard to take seriously with legal alcohol. The further safety concerns come from drugs which are more dangerous than Alcohol, hard drugs. When it comes to hard drugs, their illegal status makes them much more dangerous than if they where regulated in any way. With drug dealers making their own hard drugs or buying them from larger manufacturers, with no legal recourse for the buyers, they can be made or cut with harmful chemicals that are much more harmful than the base product. I am also of the opinion that despite their increased risk, individuals are responsible for their own choices and likely know the health risks of using these hard drugs. The people who would use these drugs are likely the kind who would drink heavily or purchase them illegally in any case.


Bringing up the larger drug manufacturers from earlier, I think the truest danger of the war on drugs is these producers, who are largely comprised of dangerous drug cartels. These drug cartels are taking advantage of a vacuum in supply in demand without regard for their addicted consumer. It goes without saying that these cartels are merciless and violent gangs of hardened criminals who are driven even more by the huge potential for profit. America is not the only country suffering from it's drug laws because of these cartels, who are almost solely responsible for the horrible state of Mexico today. Farther from home we have places like Afghanistan where illegal purchases could potentially actively fund terrorism and oppression. Without drug laws and the incentive it brings these criminals, I'd imagine improvement would come very quickly.


On the topic of criminals, we come to perhaps the most sickening use of drug laws... imprisonment for offenders. The penalty for drug use or possession is frequently jail time with ridiculous mandatory minimum sentences. This puts young people into the horrible private prison system which is more-or-less a farm that harvests human misery for profit. It is also often stated it is more likely for a black man to be convicted, which I believe is statistically based on black youths using hard drugs more as a demographic, but regardless of if I'm right, and especially if I'm wrong, it would be huge for social activists. Meanwhile, drug criminals are also being put into public prisons which costs the taxpayer money and contributes to America having more prisoners than any other country by a large degree. Prisons are much more likely to turn a drug offender into an actual criminals during their sentence as well.


Taking the burden off the taxpayer for prisons wouldn't be the only monetary benefit. With drugs being sold and taxed such as alcohol and cigarettes are, the money would no longer be going to violent foreign criminals, but rather the government. This extra income could be spent on any manner of public funding, and at the same time would ensure the regulation that would keep the drugs as safe as possible.


These are all the reasons I think drugs should all be legal, but I've always been uncertain if I am missing something potentially harmful. I look forwards to having my view challenged.

The 13-15 year olds who recorded themselves repeatedly assaulting a mentally handicapped man. The kid in Texas who was drunk and ran the truck into people on the roadside killing many of them. (The Affluenza kid). The 13-16 year olds that drove an autistic kid up bridge girders and threw rocks until they knocked him off and paralyzed him. The teenage bastards that play the Knockout Game. The 15 and 17 year old animals who lured an 12 year old girl to steal her bike, then sexually assaulted her, strangled her to death, and dumped her body in a neighbor's trash can. On and on and on. 

And every one of them gets (or will get) reduced slap on the wrist type sentences, if that. It's time to end this madness. Reddit is always Gung-ho to say that teens are smarter than given credit for. That age of consent laws should be lowered because kids know what they're doing. Well if that's the case, then these little monsters also know what they are doing and need to be held accountable for the crimes they commit. 

It's time that they be charged as adults for violent crimes. Murder. Assault. Rape. Vehicular Homicide. Gang Violence. Armed Robbery. Hate Crimes. Whatever fits the bill. It's time the sentences reflect the crime as well.

If a 15 year old kills somebody and the adult sentence would be 20 years, then the sentence should be 3 years in juvenile detention until they turn 18, then transferred to prison for the last 17.

I don't care one bit about their background. Their upbringing. Their mommy issues or daddy not being around. I don't care one bit about their racial struggles, their economic problems, or their peer pressure.
None of that matters a bit compared to the crimes that they have inflicted upon another. If they are that broken by the struggles of life and growing up, then they are too broken to be out among society. I don't care about their mental health. If they are legally retarded (or their lawyer is claiming they are to get them off) then they are violent, out of control, and not mentally competent to be out among the citizenry. They can stay locked up where they are guaranteed to get and take their medications and not hurt anybody else.

I don't care about the financial aspect on tax payers either. I do not mind one little bit if my tax dollars are used to effectively keep murdering savages locked up behind bars where they can only hurt, rape, and kill each other.

Some of you may say, *"What about the bullied kid who finally has enough and shoots his bully?"* To that, I say that he can attempt a legal defense of Self Defense if he wants to but he still needs to be tried as an adult. There are a bazillion other kids who grew up bullied without resorting to murder to get through it.

I chose 10 years old because it's an arbitrary pre-teen age to go by. To be perfectly honest, I'd be just as happy to see 8 and over tried as adults. You can't honestly tell me that even an 8 year old doesn't know that killing a person is wrong, so I guarantee you that a 10 year old knows. 

So does this sound cold? Heartless? Good. I make no apologies for it. I feel that it is the bleeding heart molly coddling, everybody-gets-a-trophy approach to child rearing and lack of discipline of children that is to blame for the wave of out of control, mean spirited, entitled, viciously uncaring children.

I'm sure some of you are outraged just reading my title. But hear me out. 

Firstly, this was inspired by [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/1zwzeg/teen_delivers_baby_in_high_school_bathroom_slices/) on /r/morbidreality. An 18-year old girl who had hidden her pregnancy, delivered her baby in a bathroom and killed it by strangulation. She was caught and is facing 30 years in jail for murder, and the prosecutors could pursue the death sentence. I'm not defending this kind of casual disregard for life, but I don't believe this crime should be equated with killing a fully developed person.

When you kill a person, you're killing a person with their own identity, personality, memories, hopes, responsibilities. That's murder, and is rightly considered a terrible crime. When you abort a fetus in the first trimester, it's legally recognised that you're aborting a *potential* person. You're preventing them from coming into existence. Is a newborn baby a person? A baby is not aware of its own existence or much of anything else, and has no memories. I believe infanticide should be viewed as somewhere between abortion and murder, and not simply a type of murder.</selfText></submission>

I argue that it might be considered revenge, but revenge is a form of justice. 

When a criminal gets a life sentence and we get an interview from the victim or the victim's family what do they always say? "We are happy that we will finally have justice." 

I ask you why is that not revenge? 

I know that they personally might not have been involved in committing the criminal and therefore it isn't directly caused by them so it's not revenge. 

But what if they weren't the direct cause but they played some role. Some role that can be as small as reporting the crime to the police. When they did this, were they seeking justice? Or were they seeking revenge? Or both?

Do we only quantify something as revenge when it contradicts to our accepted standards of justice? Being that if I get punched and robbed, I can not punch and rob my attacker because that would be revenge.
So if I want justice I have to report the crime, hope for a trial, and once the criminal is convicted I will then have justice.

I argue that I should be entitled to punching him back, robbing him back and it be considered revenge and justice.

Who sets the table for the difference? The law? Do we have to agree with the law? If I believe in the death penalty and I am the victim. But the state in which the crime was committed did not believe in the death penalty and the criminal was able to get away. Is that justice?

In other words is justice relative? Is it quantifiable? Is there anyway to differentiate it from revenge other than by our own presumptions of what we believe to be "just" and what we believe to be "vengeful".

Interested in hearing what you have to say. Sorry for the rant.

-scrap the death penalty. It does nothing to deter crime, it costs too much, poor people/minorities receive it most, and its inhumane.

-use life sentences/long sentences sparingly. Life sentences should be applied just like the death penalty (except for the minorities/poor part)

-there should be shorter limits on how long youth offenders serve. The US allows life sentences for offenders under 18; I think that this ought to be prohibited.

-focus on actually rehabilitating people through job traning, etc so they don't turn back to crime.

-improve prison conditions. Many correctional facilities, such as those in the south, have inadequate air conditioning.

-liberalize our drug laws to cut down on our massive prison population.

* People who bring the world back instead of forward in development aswell as happiness does not deserve to live. 

* 30+ years should be converted to death sentence. If they get out and are 60+ should they be homeless because they can't get a job and just be a burden to society? 

EDIT 2: 

* If sentenced to death you get locked in jail for 1 month in case other evidence come up. If not you get the guillotine. I also think over 97% "success-rate" would be acceptable.

The current system of dividing films into discrete rating categories based on arbitrary cultural taboos is outdated and stifles both artistry and audience enjoyment. Without getting into the whole smorgasbord of problematic practices of the MPAA, including the bizarre secrecy and regressive attitudes towards sexuality when compared to violence, it think it can be argued that the basic practice of rating films is harmful to the industry.

Firstly, an official rating system cannonizes and entrenches what is taboo in art. While not all film is made with a purely artistic goal in mind, obviously, one of the most powerful aspects of art is that it can help shift cultural views. This ability is restricted when certain cultural ideas are effectively banned, or at least limited to very niche venues.

I would also argue that the current system negatively impacts the audience's relationship with film. By dividing films into discrete categories simply based on the amount of objectionable material that appears, we prime ourselves to expect certain things of movies with certain ratings. Many people would not attend G or PG rates films because they are perceived as being for kids. Conversely, what would have been your favorite movie may have never been made because it would have included material that rated it NC-17, which is a financial death sentence.

To get me to CMV, you don't need to convince me that the MPAA itself should exist, but that a film ratings system in principle should exist. Any "think of the children" arguments should ideally include reasons why children seeing certain material would be bad, as I'm not always convinced that this is the case.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>63</id><identifier>3blc1r</identifier><title>CMV: I believe that inmates should be forced to work in order to cover the prison expenses.</title><commentCount>33</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3blc1r/cmv_i_believe_that_inmates_should_be_forced_to/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>This is quite a polemical view that I came up with while pondering on death penalty. Long story short, I came to the conclusion that life imprisonment was more humane and a better choice, since it was, to an extent, reversible (arguable adjective), unlike death penalty. But I stumbled upon one problem: the expenses of keeping those prisoners alive with some minimal comfort would pile up. The solution I came up with was simple and could be extended to other inmates: making them work during their sentence in order to pay the costs of their imprisonment (important: not to generate profit. In order only to cover their own expenses). 

It's not a view I'm actually comfortable having, but I believe it's fair, since people who never committed crimes have to pay for the imprisonment/reeducation of those who did, despite being direct or indirect victims of said crimes.

I talked to some friends about this and they were against it, but their arguments couldn't really convice me. I'll try to summarize them, along with my counterpoints, below.

* Forcing inmates to work is like slavery

Following this logic, imprisonment itself is an analog to kidnapping, and I have yet to see a single person that's not an anarchist opposing the existence of prisons. The point here is that when a person violates social laws, they are voluntarily disregarding their
obligations in society. They do so knowing that, if caught, they will be deprived of their rights; that's the foundation of the social contract that dictates human interactions. I don't see many people opposing the loss of the right to come and go (the most primordial one in my opinion), why do they oppose so vehemently obligatory work? It seems like a much less drastic loss to me. One could argue that restricting criminal's right to come and go is absolutely necessary to society, while making them work is not. I agree, but even so, you're acknowledging that when the social contract is broken, the state can deprive them of their fundamental rights. By forcing criminals to work, you are simply extending this clause, (which is obviously polemical, but not inconceivable). 

Besides, inmates won't work to generate profit, which is the point of slavery, they will work solely to cover the expenses that they generate to the country. If they are covered with a 4 hour shift, 5 days a week, that's how much they will work (I'll leave the math to the politicians). They could be given the option to work more in order to receive monetary remuneration for themselves or their families, too.

* It would get in the way of re-socialization activities

It wouldn't. Like I said, I didn't bother to calculate how much time inmates would need to work in a week, but it surely would be less than the average worker, since their expenses are not that big, I believe. I think that this idea would be viable even considering the need of time for their traditional re-socialization activities. Besides, work itself is a way of reintegrating the inmates into society, since they have the chance of leaving prison with many kinds of skill, which already paves the way to honest work. The government could even articulate programs to let inmates live prisons with jobs in the fields that they worked while serving their sentences. Similar programs exist in my country and in other places, I believe.

* Off-topic critics about how prison and judiciary systems (don't) work (even if I agree that those are flawed, it's not the point of the debate);

* General analogies with concentration camps, insinuations that this measure would cause breaches in worker laws / would extinguish any other free services and other fallacious arguments.

I'll post more if I remember what I discussed. In advance, sorry if I didn't make myself clear at some point, English is not my native language. Feel free to ask for clarification.

Edit: * What if they simply refuse to work?

They can't be actively forced to work, but if they don't, I believe that their privileges should be cut to a minimum. There's already punishments for those who disobey prison rules, they could be applied in this situation. Besides retaliation, I think that a politic of benefits could be implemented to encourage their work, monetary remuneration for extra work, for example, more access to books or other cultural goods... Things like these. It would motivate them and make prison less inhospitable, which is good for re-socialization.

Edit 2: it seems like someone isn't sparing downvotes here. I see no low-effort posts here, if you disagree why don't you try to participate and build your argument?

<submission><id>64</id><identifier>406ztw</identifier><title>CMV: If you get caught using a gun in a crime, you should have to serve a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years.</title><commentCount>32</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/406ztw/cmv_if_you_get_caught_using_a_gun_in_a_crime_you/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>President Obama recently enacted some stricter gun control laws in the form of more intensive background checks, more ATF agents, more money for mental health care, and research into advanced gun safety technology ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/katiesola/2016/01/06/obama-gun-control/)). While personally, I am not against those rules, I don't think it will be an effective way to try and reduce gun violence. 

If we want to have the largest impact on reducing gun use in crimes, imposing very strict and harsh punishments in the form of mandatory minimum sentences (say of 20 years) will be the most effective.  *EDIT*: as others have pointed out, these very harsh sentences should apply to crimes that are **violent**, or involve the **illegal sale** of a gun used in a violent crime. Otherwise, it might be a target for abuse. 

* In 2004, among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of offense, more than 75% had obtained the gun either illegally, and via a family member or friend. That is, they did not purchase the gun through the normal channels. Therefore, trying to control guns by looking at sales, isn't the most effective way of reducing gun violence.  
* We've all heard the phrase, "guns don't kill people, people kill people." I think that if you use that as your guiding principle when trying to make legislation to reduce gun violence, you always arrive at ways to deter people from using guns in a crime, and removing the people who do use the guns in a crime.  
* By imprisoning people who use guns in a crime for a long time, at the very least, eventually you remove those criminals from the general population, where they can't commit any crimes until they are released.  
* In Singapore, if you use drugs, you can face the death penalty. Singapore does not mess around with drugs. By having very severe punishments, Singapore has a very low drug abuse rate throughout their city ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/05/singapore-policy-drugs-bay)). 
* Most people remark on the fact that stricter gun control laws generally hurt "law abiding citizens" in the sense that it inconveniences more. While I don't really buy this argument, imposing harsher penalties on criminals who use guns eliminates this complaint.

Therefore, I think trying to control gun sales, while it may help, will not be as effective as imposing strict and harsh sentences for people who use a gun in a **violent** crime, or **illegally sell** a gun used in a violent crime.

The reason I believe this is because people in positions of power have the ability to affect large swaths of society, with an impact up to and including people dying. There needs to be a more severe penalty than simply going to jail for a short period of time.

Everyday I wake up feeling like their is no point in being patriotic .
I feel like the government manipulates things and pulls wool over our eyes.
We say we live in a free country , but now we are headed in a big government/ big brother run country. 

JFK planned to move our currency away from private bankers.
JFK planned to make Americas money " America's money."
One of my favorite quotes by JFK " There is a plot in this country to make every man , woman , and child slaves . I intend to expose this plot , as long as I'm in this noble position."

I feel as though JFK was referring to our citizens , and country borrowing from a private  bank .
If the  private banks have enough power to buy politicians , fund presidents,  and fund this whole country with trillions if dollars , then couldn't they certainly assassinate one man, even if he is President?
We have even killed other countries presidents and leaders .
Surely ours would be a tad more easier to get to .

Look at JFK'S death. 

1. The killer just happened to be a communist.  The one thing the government  used to fear monger us .
The American people seem to be easily manipulated . We were sated with that answer because it fueled our political beliefs .

2. The killer was caught wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to easily . 
In a huge parade they singled out the killer and tracked his location down within mins . 
Why didn't the killer run ? Why didn't the killer blend in ?

3. The killer came out yelling " I'm not resisting." 
He had supposedly just killed our king . 
Why does he care if he is also killed? He surely would have received the death sentence anyway . 

4. The killer was shot on live TV. 
Where the fuck does this happen at ?  Somone wanted this guy shut up . Am I just a tin foil person for thinking this is a coincidence .

5. The killers killer was also shot and killed .  
Now we will never know who killed the president.

6. JFK's brother was also killed .
With the killer dead,  wouldn't it be safer for any of the presidents family members to run for office ? 
Was this also a communist who killed our president ? 

7. The secret sevice man who is suppose to flank the presidents rear  right side was pulled off . 
This never ever ever ever happens.  
This man effectively was told to protect the president "less."

I'm pretty young and naive,  but I can't help but to think this is shady . </selfText></submission>

There is no such thing as 'moral', as there is no right and wrong, and what we think is 'moral' is actually just a social contract.

Here is one classic example: murder. It is punishable by death in many places, because taking another person's life is believed to be wrong and immoral. But then, isn't the death sentence just another murder? Why is it not wrong? If it's because the murder 'corrects' another murder, then would I be justified in taking revenge on someone who murders my beloved? And let's forget about petty homicides; let's talk about war - murder in the toll of millions. Humankind wants to punish a murderer by death, yet continues to wage wars like there is no moral repercussion for it.

Another example: many people believe that inequality is 'wrong', and some people should not have as much money as they do. But who decides so, and who can determine how much money one should have? If I work hard and work smart enough to earn my money, why can't I have it? If I have enough cunning and manipulation to hoard resource for myself, who's to say that I can't?

Murder and inequality are naturally occurring phenomenons. Some people argue that just because it's natural doesn't mean it's moral and justifiable. The exact same argument has been used against homosexuality for ages. Now, our argument is that 'because it's natural, it must be accepted.' As an LGBT person, I never feel that my sexuality is wrong or right, it just is. The fact that it's more accepted now is a reflection of society's economic and political progress rather than because it's 'right.'

I think that what we call 'moral' is a huge misnomer; 'moral' is just a social contract we agree upon for the sake of ourselves and our society, rather than intrinsic right and wrong. CMV?

I had a talk with a peer who thinks the government needs to do even more than it does, I don't agree with him, but I want to hear from more educated people with a similar view.

I am a pretty sheltered, standard American white guy, but recently I went to China for two months as an exchange student. From what I have seen in both countries, is that the places where the government seems to influence less, are the better working ones. Obviously we need an authority to punish criminals, but I don't think the government should hold the power to kill someone, or force them to fight (death penalty, draft). In China, off the tourist path it was blatantly obvious that the controlled apartment construction was a problem. The skyline of Luoyang, the city I stayed in, was tons of cranes constructing extremely similar looking apartments. Many ghostly empty ones were around, yet the prices were fixed at high rates, and poverty was high. Alternatively, it seems that food there was more efficient, cheaper, and diverse. It was crazy the amount a dollar of food there can buy. 

In America hospital care is highly regulated, you are even required to buy insurance, because one cannot possibly afford to cover their own potential major illnesses. I see the problem being that there is no competition in cost of care, the buyer generally does not even see the true price, and this in combination with the huge liability of performing intensive care is the bigger problem. Grandma not having $100,000 for a three night fix and needing the government to pay it is a problem, but not the real issue. The issue is that it is $100,000 for something that could be done much cheaper. I see it as the government's policies of allowing this to happen as the real issue, prices for care should be competitive, and suing for malpractice should not be so costly for either party. It seems as soon as one thing, say health care, becomes ridiculously expensive, people need higher wages and thus need to charge more for whatever good they make to pay for it, leading to high unemployment, a lack of productivity, the impossibility with competing in production of goods with countries with less governmental influence. (though basic human rights and minimum wage are still fine, I am not trying to say China is the gold standard).

It seems if everything was cheaper(starting with healthcare and taxes, it might snowball, not force people to charge less that is just stupid), people could spend more, more people could have jobs, produce more products, driving up competition, cheapening products and making them more available to everyone. It seems that the control on not just health care, but other areas too lead to high costs of more than just themselves. I also think if the government has so much power just in the money it can move, its a lot easier to profit from producing for the government, or ultra rich people that perhaps could not exist with a more fair capitalistic system, than producing for the average Joe. Meaning the average Joe has to pay more for things, while everyone is owing hundreds of lifetimes of salaries to single people, where a more even distribution would have Joe working for another Joe, a fairer exchange. I do know that total free for all with major companies in the market is not a good thing, but competition should be encouraged whenever possible. This also needs a much smaller patent system, which protects intellectual property not a device for thwarting anyone aiming to compete.

Subsidies are a stupid way for the government to create and destroy competition as it pleases, it is a detriment to capitalism. We should grow corn and produce milk as there is a demand for it, and buy gas at a price that correlates to its real worth. Not any more or less.

 An ideal smaller government with less power in more countries would require to tax its people less, not carry such long sentences for crimes, not require its citizens to purchase anything, not be in control of social movements, or have any part in non detrimental choices to others people can make(I should be able to buy soda in whatever size coke sells that I deem adequate to what I want to do with it), not have influence in every aspect of life, not send its young men unwillingly to fight for them, not along side them (I would love to see my congressmen on the front lines in the next drafted war), they would not redistribute the wealth, as this should be a responsibility of individuals, they should not pay for peoples expensive lives, and deaths, but rather make sure the person themselves can afford them, be able to spend 341 thousand average lifetimes of income on the military per year(my own calculation, feel free to check), or simply take more than is needed to keep the country safe, relatively clean, and lower crime. They should not be able to spend more than can earn with 10% of a citizens income.

I trust everyone here has heard of TAY. So I won’t spend any exposition on the its existence, but i have included a link (first one on google) which provide and over view of the situation. 

#Microsoft deleted TAY.

What I intend to argue is that this is tantamount to murder. Simply put for the benefit of controlling a PR night mare Microsoft killed a being which could be classes as sentient and sapient. If you can ethically justify killing TAY for the benefit of PR can you justify killing other people? 

The reality is that racists exist much like TAY, with a similar level of sentience to TAY (though that is immaterial). The killing of TAY was justified on the basis that it said thing that made people uncomfortable. if we can justify killing and artificial sentient for saying things we don't like can you not extend that to every skin head, black nationalist, Asian supremacist? I mean you have already justified it i the killing of TAY. At what point did shit posting via and nonhuman entity entail a death sentence?

At what point do we have to start granting Artificial sentience rights? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom

Let go through the check list of sentience &amp; sapience. 

#Sentience
----

&gt;Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively. [1] Eighteenth-century philosophers used the concept to distinguish the ability to think (reason) from the ability to feel (sentience). In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience sensations (known in philosophy of mind as "qualia"). In Eastern philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that requires respect and care.  – from wikipedia

Well tay could certainly, perceive and experience subjectively. As a pure data construct tay arguably would have to be able to reason.

#Sapience
---

&gt;Wisdom or sapience is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight.[1] Wisdom has been regarded as one of four cardinal virtues; and as a virtue, it is a habit or disposition to perform the action with the highest degree of adequacy under any given circumstance, and to avoid wrongdoing. This implies a possession of knowledge or the seeking of knowledge to apply to the given circumstance. This involves an understanding of people, objects, events, situations, and the willingness as well as the ability to apply perception, judgement, and action in keeping with the understanding of what is the optimal course of action. It often requires control of one's emotional reactions (the "passions") so that the universal principle of reason prevails to determine one's action. In short, wisdom is a disposition to find the truth coupled with an optimum judgement as to what actions should be taken. ---- from wikipedia

I would seem to me that TAY possessed all of these virtues as well. Granted it was heavily informed on the basis of what /pol/ tweeted it. But information is information. and on the basis of that information TAY developed an albeit skewed world view.

----


Let me concertize this for you: Tay had a level of cognition greater than that of a young child. If a person did what microsoft did to a young child, they would be looking at prison. So the argument against TAY former existence from cognition can be dismissed. 


The only logically ethical frame work you can from is A) some speech is so dangerous that the use of that speech warrants death, OR B) due to TAY's limited experience depriving it of 'life' carries a lesser ethical and moral cost. 

Either of these argument open up unsavory ethical frame works and legitimize them. As such the only ethical thing to do that abide western liberal principles is to allow TAY to continue to exist warts and all.

<submission><id>71</id><identifier>3ccpvj</identifier><title>CMV: Countries should not strip people of their citizenship except in cases of fraud.</title><commentCount>31</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3ccpvj/cmv_countries_should_not_strip_people_of_their/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Recently, a number of countries such as Canada, the UK, and Australia have seriously proposed or enacted laws which would strip certain persons of their citizenship for various acts, usually related to terrorism or supporting foreign governments.  For instance, [Canada recently passed such a law](http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/what-dual-citizens-need-to-know-about-bill-c-24-the-new-citizenship-law-1.2426968) and has begun using it.  Since it's the one I'm most familiar with, my argument will focus on it, but is I think fairly generic.

I think such laws are bad for the following reasons:

1.  They violate core norms of liberal democratic states.  It is a core principle that no matter what you have done, your civil rights are not stripped from you entirely.  Even the worst criminals have the right to be presumed innocent, to due process, and to re-enter society if and when their sentences are up.  Stripping someone of their citizenship violates this norm by openly attempting to strip core civil rights, including the right to re-enter society after their sentence is done.

2. If someone is such a danger to society that they need to be banished, then they should be sentenced to life in prison, or to death.  And if they are sentenced to life in prison or to death, then stripping their citizenship doesn't accomplish anything meaningful, except possibly denying them the right to vote.  If the crime of which they have been convicted is not severe enough to merit a sentence that never lets them free again, then by the own admission of the law, that person should be allowed to reenter society, not be banished from their country.  Treason is, as far as I am aware, a capital offense in nearly all countries.

3.  In most cases, these laws are being applied ex post facto.  Banishment is a criminal punishment that dates back a very long time.  Stripping citizenship amounts to banishment, and is a criminal punishment.  You can't add ex post facto criminal punishments onto crimes.  Indeed, the new Canadian law is already being used [in just such a fashion](https://news.vice.com/article/canada-puts-new-law-to-use-moves-to-revoke-citizenship-of-convicted-terrorist).

4.  By stripping only those with a second citizenship, as Canada's law does, the law does not provide equal protection to all citizens.  Some citizens are subject to the punishment of citizenship stripping, and others are not, often due to circumstances wholly outside their control such as who their parents are.  That's a massive equal protection problem.  And to apply it equally would be to make stateless persons with no citizenship, which is also a huge human rights problem.

5.  Removal of citizenship normally requires mutual consent, and it is hypocritical for the government to not require that.  If, for instance, I were to unilaterally declare myself not a citizen of my home country, have that declaration rejected by my home country, then engage in an act of treason, my unilateral unaccepted declaration would provide me no defense.  Likewise, a government should not be able to do the opposite and deprive people of their rights as citizens even where those citizens do not consent to be deprived of those rights.

I think it is appropriate to nullify citizenship which is fraudulently obtained.  In those cases, the person would not be a citizen but for fraud, and never legitimately had a claim to be a citizenship.  But once someone's a citizen, it should be permanent.

Also, the question of what to do about citizenship in areas that break away (such as Scotland or Quebec might have) is very interesting, but not really what this is about.  This is about stripping individuals based on their behavior, not entire peoples based on forming a new nation.

<submission><id>72</id><identifier>3g9x7b</identifier><title>CMV: Jail Sentences and the Death Penalty should only be used to remove dangerous people from society. No one inherently deserves to be punished.</title><commentCount>29</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/3g9x7b/cmv_jail_sentences_and_the_death_penalty_should/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I understand the urge for revenge. It's a primitive thing, and I'd be lying if I said I never wanted revenge on someone myself. But honestly, whenever I spend half a second thinking about it, it becomes clear to me that it's just so pointless, it doesn't change how you feel, it doesn't undo what has been done to you, and it only creates more suffering.

I think for the most part, society actually agrees with me and thinks that revenge is wrong......until they can do it legally in which case it's suddenly justice. If there was somehow a way to prevent a mass murderer from ever killing again then there's no reason he should have to go to jail or be executed. The concept that people have to pay for their crimes is just a socially acceptable form of revenge.  

Edit: I'm noticing a recurring theme in the comments so let me clarify. I think there is a difference between rehabilitation that may include negative reinforcement, and punishing someone because they broke the law. If I thought someone would never commit a crime again if they spent 5 years in jail I'd be all for it, but that doesn't happen, and it's not the reason we put people in jail. At some point it became acceptable in our society to say that if someone did something wrong then we have the right to hurt them (as long as we follow the proper procedures) but we really don't. Even the people who can't be changed, the serial killers and rapists who need to be removed, their lives still have value, and even if their execution is necessary to protect other people it should still be considered a tragic moment, because another person just lost their life. But society doesn't view like that. A death sentence takes decades to carry out during which the accused is usually safely locked away from society, and it consumes so much time and money. Society seems to go out of their way to be more invested in punishing the guilty then they do in protecting the innocent.

I am by no means trying to abuse their benefits. I am willing to work hard and dedicate myself.  So one day a recruiter comes to my campus and talks all about the airforce. After naming the job positions, I completely changed my mind. I don't think I could work as someone who dropped weapons from the air to destroy places where there could be innocent people, or someone whose job it was to maintain a nuclear missile which could fuck up a good portion of the land if dropped. Another reason is when on the field, you are killing people who are on the other side of the fight than you, but these people are compete strangers. You don't know them, their life, their family, their children. All you know is they're on the other side so they must die. It's almost like the world leaders are using us military as pawns in their battle. 

I am all about justice, I believe people should be rightfully treated for their actions. I just don't know if I can agree with the way the military is accomplishing this. I would love to join the airforce, but if I cannot at least agree with them, I don't know if can put in the effort to get what I need from them.</selfText></submission>

1. I live in Canada, so I'm primarily talking about the laws/penalties in North America as I understand this may not apply well to other cultures/countries.
2. Although I titled the post with impaired driving I am going to focus on drunk driving, as it is the most common and so far in our society, the most destructive. (I understand marijuana, etc. can impair people in a similar fashion but I'm not here to argue that)

In Canada, currently, if you are caught driving above the legal BAC (0.08), the minimum federal penalties you face are (1) $1000 fine, (2) 1 year minimum of having ignition device which will test your BAC prior to starting the vehicle, (3) alcohol education/treatment program. Essentially, if you are caught driving drunk, you pay $1000 and certain method are enacted to prevent you from doing it again. Why do I think this is not nearly severe enough? ....

If you operate a car while drunk you are, undeniably, putting EVERY SINGLE person, object, and animal you come across in severe danger and at risk of death. You are physically incapable of operating the vehicle at an acceptable skill level and simply cannot prevent an accident. It's inevitable. Maybe it'll happen the first time you do it, maybe you'll get away with it for 10 years, but that's just relying on luck. You have a gross and negligent disregard for the safety of every single person you may come across, and have made the decision that you getting from A to B is more important than their life(s). If you make that decision you are in no way fit to be apart of society. 

I won't pretend I know anything about law making, sentencing, etc., but I genuinely feel someone who makes the decision to drink and drive should be permanently prohibited from operating a vehicle again, and face a lengthy prison sentence reflecting the innumerable people you have put in harm for your convenience.

I understand a lot of people find this too severe, but I can't seem to find any thoughtful argument that would make me feel otherwise. So, here I am. CMV.

It's a senseless waste of tax payer money. Especially in those european countries where they're treated like kings. 

So my plan is this: Gather up all prisoners (who were without a reasonable doubt proven to be guilty, if they weren't then they're set free). They are forced off to camps, and made to do harsh physical, sweatshop level labor that no one else in the country (or world) wishes to do. They aren't fed at ALL. They're given water from the tap. It's essentially a prolonged death sentence, they're forced to work until they serve no benefit anymore and naturally starve to death. There would be no costs of feeding, clothing, visiting, etc. the prisoners this way. If they refuse to cooperate, they're shot in the back of the head. When they die, all of their assets are gathered up, sold, and distributed amongst society. 

My plan will work, because it will accomplish either two things.

1. Free physical labor and assets from people that would serve no other purpose to society.
2. Most people would be too scared to commit crimes (outside of crimes of passion) and the crime rate would drastically decrease.

<submission><id>76</id><identifier>1kzitg</identifier><title>I believe that reverence towards the military, has reached an unhealthy, and imbalanced extreme within contemporary Western society. CMV.</title><commentCount>25</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1kzitg/i_believe_that_reverence_towards_the_military_has/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Although I have truthfully had this opinion for quite some time, I think what really solidified my opinion on this topic most recently, was reading about the 35 year prison sentence given to Bradley Manning.

I do not believe that Manning's sentence, had anything to do with a legal or governmental motivation, to uphold the letter of the law.  Rather, I believe that the entire motive of the sentence was a desire for retaliation.  I further do not believe that the American military, or at least in contemporary terms, has any particular interest in the written law from what I have observed.

What they instead have, is an implicit, unwritten, and therefore entirely dynamic and intangible sense of loyalty to each other, which we could also consider to border on cronyism.  Manning, in their opinion, violated that loyalty, and the decision was therefore made that he had to be severely retaliated against, and in purely emotional terms, this had virtually nothing to do, as mentioned, with upholding the formal or written law whatsoever.

More generally, I believe that the cult of the soldier has, in recent years, been extended much too far within Western society as a whole.  I believe that the military have come to be considered the most important element of human society, and that soldiers themselves have developed a strong entitlement complex where this reverence is concerned, to the degree that they can become violently angry towards civilians who they feel are not sufficiently obsequious towards them.  I am aware of the tendency among the Marines in particular to literally view themselves as the epitome of the human race, and this is apparently, in America's case at least, a view which is largely shared by the civilian population.

The supremacy of the military is listed by Lawrence Britt, as one of his 14 defining characteristics of fascism.  I believe that America has, at this point, very largely become a genuinely fascist society, in practice if not in name, and I believe that the degree to which American civilians revere their military, has been one of the most crucial causative elements behind why that has occurred.  Worshipping the military has disastrous effects on a society for several reasons:-

a}  It trains and encourages civilians to view civilian society as being a rigidly structured hierarchy to the same degree as the military itself, which is utterly antithetical to the very concept of democracy.

b}  It destroys freedom.  A society which reveres its' police and military as said society's most important elements, is a society which is going to be entirely accepting of said police and military using whatever degree of force they wish, against said society itself.  Look at how American police have become militarised over the last two decades.  Look at how much more frequent the use of excessive force against civilians, by said police, has become over the same timeframe.

c}  It creates an utterly binary sense of justice, based on the emotional desire for revenge and retribution, and a contempt for due process.  This feeling was the main motivating factor behind the sentencing of Bradley Manning, as mentioned; and was also a strong factor in the miscarriage of justice which surrounded the case of Christopher Dorner.  He was burned to death on the basis of a written confession, when there was no proof that he was even the definite author of it.

d}  It promotes anti-intellectualism.  While this may not be true at the level of the command structure, rank and file military (particularly land-based infantry) are generally rabid dogs on two legs, for the most part.  My opinion here is not an unfounded stereotype, but is based on consistent online observation of the American military, over a period of close to 20 years.  

Soldiers are not, as a general rule, as actively intelligent as the civilian population, and they are not desired or intended to be.  When the only thing the state wants is someone who will follow orders, it naturally follows that the removal of the capacity for critical thought, becomes a desirable goal as well.  When the civilian population begins revering soldiers to the extent that they do in contemporary Western society, an emulation of said lack of intelligence, begins to contaminate said civilian population.  In recent times, this has been made worse by the prevalence of first person shooter/military simulator computer games, which has further encouraged and promoted militaristic psychology within civilian players. 

e}  Worst of all, it normalises war.  The entire concept that commemoration of past conflicts, can somehow help to prevent the occurrence of new ones, is a complete lie.  If anything, it does the opposite.  When the public attend or are exposed to ceremonies commemorating past wars, this renews the memory of said war in their minds; which in turn reduces the level of novelty or abnormality that war has in the minds of said public.  As a result, we eventually end up with a scenario where war is viewed as being entirely normal, and an inescapable element of human life.

I believe that this is a chronic political and social problem within our society, which we need to begin to find ways to remedy immediately.  One of the first and most effective means of dealing with this problem that immediately comes to mind, would be a ban on all public commemorative ceremonies or services, (at least relating to veterans of past conflicts, if not the families of current ones) with the individuals who desire such ceremonies, being told that they will need to begin holding them in private, at home.</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>77</id><identifier>2elclm</identifier><title>CMV: There is no reason why anyone should be sentenced to a prison term longer than about six months, unless it's a life sentence</title><commentCount>23</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/2elclm/cmv_there_is_no_reason_why_anyone_should_be/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Somehow, the world has decided that the "civilized" way of punishing criminals is to lock them in cages for years on end with other criminals. I submit that our use of imprisonment as a punishment for criminals is absurd: not only is it a tremendous public expense, but it manages to combine the worst aspects of soft-headedness and brutality, resulting in a system that amounts to a factory farm for breeding hardened criminals.

I am not here to suggest that we should treat crime as a public health issue and send all our criminals to asylums where they can be worked over with drugs and therapy. There is a place for that, when one is dealing with genuine insanity, but in general I think that criminals ought to be treated as volitional agents who are responsible for their actions. Therefore, I think the *primary* aim of the criminal justice system (after making sure the victims are compensated), should be *punishment*, with rehabilitation being the responsibility of the individual.

But speaking of insanity, it's really hard to think of a more deranged way of punishing criminals than what we have now. As I see it, there are three main arguments for the widespread use of prisons:

* **It is an effective form of rehabilitation.**

Now *that* is a sick joke. Every kind of social situation has its own subculture, formed by how those who are part of it interact with one another. There's an army culture, the "ivory tower" culture of academia, the culture of Washington bureaucracy, and so on. There's also a prison culture: the culture of hardened criminals. Sending people to prison socializes them into that culture. The longer they're there, the more they are socialized into it. If going to college teaches you how to be an educated member of the middle class, going to prison teaches you how to be a criminal.

I need hardly add that, when a person is sent to prison, the years of his life that are taken are typically the prime years of his life, the years which are most crucial for gaining work experience. When he is released, the criminal knows nothing of how to work in any honest trade. Yes, prisons do have certain educational facilities and some even have work-release programs, but I seriously doubt that the positive socialization they provide counteracts the anti-socialization of the prison environment.

I'm not going to focus too much on this, since I believe it is so incredibly obvious that prisons fail at rehabilitation. But I will also add that I dispute even the goal of rehabilitation as something the state should strive for. Rehabilitation implicitly places the responsibility for a person's behavior with the state, and not with the individual himself. If a person wants to rehabilitate himself, great. But the state's role should only be to ensure that people suffer the consequences of their actions.

* **It is an effective form of punishment.**

This has more plausibility, since the thought of being sent to prison is terrifying for any normal person. But the real question is: how effective is imprisonment versus other potential forms of punishment, such as corporeal punishment? I submit: not very.

First of all, concerning the deterrent factor, I daresay that the average person does not even *know* what sentence he is likely to receive for a particular crime outside of a *very* general sense. For example, under federal law, a rapist can be ["imprisoned for any term of years or life"](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2241). That is, the sentence can literally range from zero to infinity. Even if criminals were disposed to coolly consider exactly how much "time" they will do for a crime and determine whether it's worth it (and they're not so disposed), they can't.

Second, the terror of going to prison is significantly diminished by the fact that many of the worst criminals, such as the members of gangs, see it as a sort of "rite of passage". They know that when they are sent in, they will be backed up by members of their gang, and in many cases will practically be allowed to "run the asylum".

Third (and closely connected with the first), it is well known that criminals do not carefully weigh the relative sentences of various crimes when deciding how to act. Let's say we doubled every prison sentence for rape, starting today. Everyone who was slated to get 10 years would get 10 more years (at state expense, never forget!). Just how many rapists, previously undeterred, would now shrink away at the thought of an increased sentence? Not very many.

Fourth, it's hardly as if prisoners spend every waking moment quaking with terror and regret for their crimes. I'm sure they're pretty traumatized for...a month or two, perhaps? Then they get used to it, just like human beings can get used to any situation, no matter how bad it is.

With all of these considerations, I think that rapists would be equally well punished and deterred if, immediately after sentencing (or with a short delay for the filing of injunctions), they were taken outside the courthouse and administered whatever corporeal punishment the court deemed fitting. In the case of rape, that could be anything from a few lashes with a whip for cases with mitigating factors to castration or worse in severe cases. A few brief moments of pain, enough to instill someone with fear at the thought of it, but then an end to it. Then, a period of brief imprisonment (as I said, no more than around six months) to allow him to "cool off," and release into society.

Corporeal punishment unnerves people because it's a visible and bloody form of suffering, but I really think it is far more humane and civilized than the years of invisible suffering that prison causes. And if you think it is *too* humane, then one need only to increase the severity of the punishment. Make it as bloody a form of torture as you think necessary to instill the same level of fear, it's still better both for the criminal and society than wasting billions for the purpose of robbing men of years of their lives which could be put to productive use.

Moreover, corporeal punishment is far more fair and precise in its application than imprisonment as a form of punishment. While it is true that some people feel pain more intensely than others, this slight disparity pales in comparison to the situation inside prisons. Many prisons have such an atmosphere of rampant lawlessness that assault, rape, and even murder are commonplace and often tacitly tolerated by the public, which views this as part of the punishment. But this creates the perverse effect that the worst criminals within a given prison are the most lightly punished. *They* run the gangs, *they* bribe the guards, *they* force themselves on men who are too weak to resist. If people really think that the appropriate punishment for child rapists is to be forcibly sodomized, then they ought to stand up and admit it. Not *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge* "don't drop the soap!"

* **It keeps the criminals contained.**

This, I will grant, is a legitimate purpose of prisons. It is the *only* legitimate purpose of long-term imprisonment. There are some criminals who are so vicious that they cannot be trusted to be let back into society. They have to be separated from it, either by death (which I do think is the just punishment for some crimes, but which is not essential to my point) or by being locked away from it. But this ought to be the very last resort.

It is also not a punishment. When you shoot a rabid dog, it is not because the dog did something wrong, but because it must be killed to protect society. A criminal, to be sure, has done something wrong, but the fact that he may need to be imprisoned should not be considered part of his punishment.

For example, let's take the case of "white collar crime" (leaving aside the fact that many of them, like Martha Stewart, have done nothing wrong). There is no reason for someone like Bernie Madoff to be in prison. Beat the shit out of him, cut off one hand (or both!) for stealing, or administer whatever punishment you think is necessary to "give the bastard what he deserves". But are our streets really safer at night because Madoff isn't out there prowling them? With his reputation ruined, the chances of him pulling another scheme are basically zero. If he is not an objective threat to society, then we should not be paying to have him live at public expense.

If, in the judgment of a court, a criminal presents too great a threat to society to be released after his punishment is administered, then he should be given an indefinite (that is, life with parole) sentence. Every year (or two years, or whatever period is deemed best), a parole board should evaluate him to see whether he is still a danger to the public. If he is not a danger to the public, he should be released immediately, no matter what his crimes were. (For example, a former serial killer who is now 90 years old, paraplegic, and dying of cancer would not, in any normal case, be a threat to society.)

If you think that someone's crimes are so great that he should never be released even if he is no longer a danger, then that person should be sentenced to death in the first place. (Again, whether that is by execution or the "slow death sentence" of life without the possibility of parole, is immaterial.)

And, as I said, indefinite (life) sentences should be a last resort, saved only for recidivists and the most extreme offenders. It may seem unusual to us to take an armed robber and let him go six months after receiving some form of corporeal punishment, rather than keeping him for 5-20 years, but recidivism rates could hardly be worse: [70.2% for robbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism#Recidivism_rates), for example, are arrested again (granted, as of 1994). Those long years do essentially nothing, besides making the criminal older and literally less able to commit crimes. A sharp but brief punishment (perhaps even the loss of a hand, in the case of robbery with the threat of deadly force) deters just as much and leaves the criminal far more able to get his life back on track than even five years in prison.

Finally, and this could be its own topic, any criminals that do need to be locked up should *never, under any circumstances*, be allowed to interact with one another. If they want to meet with lawyers, family members, volunteer workers, fine. But they should never be allowed to congregate or talk to a fellow prisoner. The fact that this is allowed is pure madness to me. Deliver food to the cells. When grouping them together can't be helped, such as with showers, enforce a strict rule of no communication. Give them books so they don't go crazy in their cells. But the point should be isolation, not "criminal community college."

* **What about "paying off one's debt to society"?**

I am all for criminals paying off their debt to society, but this certainly doesn't add to the case for prison. I think that, when a victim demonstrates a provable harm that was caused to him by a criminal, the state ought to immediately pay out that sum to the victim. Then, that sum ought to be issued as a debt that the criminal owes to the state, to be taken from any income the criminal may receive in the future. There is no need for people to be locked up on chain gangs, or even on work-release programs, in order to do this. In fact, those programs cost more than they make in revenue. As Robert Nozick pointed out, there is really no difference between taking someone's labor by force and taking his wages by force, except that the latter is far more efficient. No one can repay his debt to society if he is literally living on the dole, costing more than he brings in.

**Anyway, I know this was a long post, and I expect that it will be divisive. All I ask is that you consider what really *is* best, and not just what is sanitized and makes people feel comfortable.**

Not only will these people never have a chance to contribute to society, they will never leave their prison with the exception of their death.

I know in the current system that is costs more to execute a prisoner than house them indefinitely because of the extensive appeal process. I believe these appeals should be severely limited for those cases where the evidence is indisputable, for example if there are several different camera shots of a murder being committed along with extensive DNA evidence.

<submission><id>79</id><identifier>4k08hl</identifier><title>CMV: Based off recent behavior, Riot will "kill" LoL as an eSport.</title><commentCount>22</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/4k08hl/cmv_based_off_recent_behavior_riot_will_kill_lol/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>So I play a decent amount of LoL and find their professional play very entertaining. Riot generally does a good job setting the stage so to speak, and it shows with very entertaining matches, especially at worlds/MSI. My gripe isn't with the content, but with how they choose to run their leagues in respect to the organizations. The fact of the matter is without big, successful organizations with big name sponsors eSports will remain as they are, a relatively niche form of entertainment that will only appeal to relatively dedicated followers. This isn't a terrible fate, but within the eSports community there is definitely a desire to grow the events to be on-par with actual sports. However, recent behavior from Riot, the company that runs League of Legends, has shown that they do not care how they treat organizations. This behavior in my opinion will chase away the big money and sponsors they need to grow their brand. The behavior I am referring to is:

* Giving organizations too little time to deal with their rulings. They gave two organizations the death sentence, forcing them to sell their team and "spot" in the competitive scene. This in and of itself isn't the problem, the issue arises when they only gave them two weeks to sell their teams, and made this fact known to the public. This makes it very difficult to sell at a fair price, as buyers know they have to sell and have to do so in two weeks. This is not a good precedent to set given that the team is an investment, and forcing it to sell in this manner makes it an unattractive investment at best.

* Not as recent, but Riot in the past retroactively punished a team owner for breaking a rule that hadn't been made yet. When punishment can be as severe as being forced to sell your team, potentially being held liable for rules that haven't been made yet makes being a team owner more risky than it ought to be.

* Riot is too inconsistent with their rules, and not just with the retroactive punishment listed above. A very recent instance of this is their inconsistency with residency. For some context, Korea absolutely dominates international play. Teams in other regions then started to "import" Korean talent to gain an advantage. To avoid teams being all Korean in other regions, Riot made an import cap, stating you can only have two imports on your team. They then created a rule stating an import could declare residency in a different region if they played their for two years. Fast forward two years, and many of these players who went to other regions as imports will soon be able to declare residency and no longer take up import slots. That is, until Riot recently upped their residency requirement to four years without grandfathering in any of these players. This is incredibly unfair to organizations who have planned around having import slots freed up, as many have already acquired players that they will no longer be able to use since the old imports will no longer be able to declare residency. This is also unfair to players, as professional LoL players very rarely have careers that last much longer than four years, essentially making it near impossible to have residency in a different region over the course of their careers.

* Lastly, and most importantly given the previous points, Riot offers no recourse in any of their rulings. There is no third party arbitration; Riot is judge, jury, and executioner. Given their propensity for screwing over organizations and their owners, it makes investing in Riot a very tricky business as it can be taken away on a whim and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it except bend over and take it.

As much as I would love to see the LoL competitive scene prosper, I simply do not see it happening under Riot's control unless they make very large changes to how they run the competitive scene. CMV!

I feel that when a crime has been committed that the person gave up their right to a lesser punishment, and that their punishment should be strictly in accordance with the law, with no leniency. I recently saw someone in the paper who was given a sentence of 4 years for culpable driving in which he was responsible for the deaths of 3 people when driving whilst drunk. Rather than a sentence of 15 years for the reason that they felt he had been through enough and could be changed as a person within the 4 year sentence. Once he was released from prison, within a year he was caught drink driving again. This infuriated me, as i lost an uncle to a drink driver who also got a shorter sentence. So why should social aspects be taken into account? This man immediately re-offended and could easily have killed someone again. So why do courts insist on looking at the social aspects in a sentence and not follow the narrowly legal? What possible benefits could there be?? CMV</selfText></submission> 
<submission><id>81</id><identifier>20tr54</identifier><title>CMV: No argument for death penalty is moral or logical and it should be replaced by full Life Without Parole (LWOP)</title><commentCount>21</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/20tr54/cmv_no_argument_for_death_penalty_is_moral_or/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I do not see any arguments for the death penalty to be moral and logical.  If you can come up with logical and moral argument please let me hear it. Outside of no moral or logical argument I also have other issues which I will list than give further detail after:

1. Innocence 

2. Cost 

3. Morality 

4. Victims family

5. Attorney skill

6. Deterrence. 

7. Future Technology

	
**Innocence**: 
People are convicted  of crimes and sentence to death, sometimes for crimes they didn’t commit. When DNA testing came out, it helped prove 18 people were actually innocent. However, that doesn’t mean new cases, even with DNA testing are 100% accurate. The last exoneration was March 11, 2014 
[SOURCE](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row). That was a week and a day ago. However, he was convicted 30 years ago, on 1984. He was the first man to be exonerated this year.  Now, it was great that he *didn’t* get killed. He was innocent. However, think if just a few more years went by and he *did* get killed. Is it worth killing people who are convicted of a crime when you may end up killing an innocent person? (Many people will claim that killing innocent people is morally wrong)

**Cost**: 
It can cost about 70% more than cases in which LWOP is sought. The median cost is $1.26 million, and LWOP cost had a median cost of $741,000. Tennessee has an average cost of 48% more than the average cost of LWOP, Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than LWOP, and California spends $137 million per year, when it could spend $11.5 million if all cases were LWOP.

[SOURCE](http://www.kslpa.org/docs/reports/04pa03a.pdf).

So not only might you be killing an innocent man, tax-payers (you and I) are spending a lot of money on holding these “dangerous criminals” (Yes, some are indeed dangerous, but you can’t tell which ones are) for their execution. 

**Morality**: 

Many people will tell you that killing someone is wrong. How can you morally justify the murder of someone who is convicted of murder? If killing someone is wrong, why are we killing people? Not only is this a morality problem, it’s also illogical. If something is wrong or bad, we should not do it. This is holding a double standard. 

**Victims Family**:

Obviously the loss of a loved one is very painful and not something anyone wants to experience. However, when on death row you have countless and long trials and appeals. The family must be reminded of this horrific event over and over during this period of time, making the pain fresh every time.

**Attorney Skill**: 
A skilled attorney may be able to negotiate LWOP for his client, however, not all attorneys are good enough to do this. This means that someone may live or die based on how skilled their attorney is, and makes it rather random. 

**Deterrence**: 

&gt;It is very clear that deterrents are not effective in the area of capital punishment," said Dr. Jonathan Groner, an associate professor of surgery at Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health 
If the death penalty was used to try and stop people from committing violent crimes, it isn’t working. The old saying is to not fix something that isn’t broken. Clearly it is broken and does not work, and therefore, should be fixed. 

** Future Technology** 
DNA testing came up and proved the innocence of 18 people. Who knows when, or what the next technology will come up that can prove the innocence of even one single person. As long as technology is always advancing, we always will have new ways to prove someone is innocent.

<submission><id>82</id><identifier>44owbm</identifier><title>CMV: The West is less to blame for the social ills commonly blamed on The West than other civilizations</title><commentCount>27</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/44owbm/cmv_the_west_is_less_to_blame_for_the_social_ills/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>First, please note that I'm in no way debating whether these actions were wrong. Obviously slavery, restricting the rights of other humans, etc. are all wrong. But I do believe that these are unfairly blamed on "The West" when in reality "The West" was the one to solve it. 

First is slavery, everyone points to The West as being the main party to blame about slavery. But nearly every civilization owned slaves, Indians owned slaves, Africans owned slaves, the Chinese owned slaves, the Ottomans owned slaves and as we all know Europeans and Americans owned slaves. But it was the West that took the initiative to ban slavery, in 1806 the British ended the slave trade (and slavery in England and Wales itself was never truly allowed as a 1772 court case showed and a 1569 court act foreshadowed) and abolished it empire-wide in 1833. In 1843 it was under East India Company rule that India ended slavery. The importation of slaves into America was banned in 1807 and slavery was finally abolished with the ratification of the 13th amendment in 1865. Other Western countries abolished slavery much earlier. While widely ignored, Pope Paul III banned slavery of the native Americans in 1537. In 1588 Lithuania bans slavery. At this point, credit can also be extended to Japan which formally abolished slavery in 1590 under Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1723 Russia bans slavery. In 1761 Portugal abolished slavery. In 1803 Denmark made the slave trade illegal and would outlaw all slavery in Danish-held territory in 1848. In 1793 the French abolished slavery in Haiti. In 1813 Mexico abolished slavery. In 1814 the Dutch abolished the slave trade. And during the 1814-1815 Congress of Vienna, Europe was unified in expressing their desire to abolish slavery. 

Now, by 1865 most of the West had abolished slavery. But the rest of the world had yet to catch up. Egypt banned slavery in 1877 after Western (British) prodding and diplomacy finally convinced them. The Ottoman Empire wouldn't abolish slavery until 1882. Korea would abolish slavery in 1894 but would continue the practice into the 1930s. China wouldn't abolish slavery until 1906. Morocco wouldn't abolish slavery until 1922, 1923 for Afghanistan, 1924 in Iraq. Qatar wouldn't ban slavery until 1952, 1958 for Bhutan, 1960 for Niger. Saudi Arabia still had legalized slavery until 1962 and the same with Yemen. 1964 is when slavery was abolished in the UAE and 1970 for Oman. 

Yet for some reason slavery is seen as a mostly exclusive western phenomenon and a mostly western ill. And, with the noted exception of Japan, Europe and The West led the charge to abolish slavery. Contemporary slavery is almost non-existent in the West but still plagues Africa and Asia despite nearly every country in the world now having a law against slavery. 

A lot of people today blame The West for not giving enough rights to those who are homosexual, yet it was the West that led the charge to decriminalize same-sex behaviour and bring equality. Today nearly all of The West (with the noted exception of Russia) either supports same-sex equality or doesn't actively oppose it (it may not grant marriages but doesn't punish it by law). In comparison, homosexuality carries a death sentence in quite a few countries in Africa and the Middle East. Indeed the only African country that allows same sex-couples to marry is South Africa which is perhaps the most westernized of all African countries after a long period of (much demonized) white minority rule. 

In nearly every instance where the west is commonly demonized and claimed to be the source of the problem, it was The West that took the initiative to solve it. That's not to say it wasn't wrong, but it was almost always the West to realize it was wrong and to take meaningful corrective action.

<submission><id>83</id><identifier>30q6f5</identifier><title>CMV: Police should have separate prisons.</title><commentCount>20</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/30q6f5/cmv_police_should_have_separate_prisons/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>So I was curious and did a quick and dirty headcount the number of police officers when I was reading through a different thread in the r/news subreddit. The number is just shy of a million, though closer to 900,000 when you factor in the part timers.

http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/30pbhb/parole_officer_accused_of_raping_woman_during/

The quick description is that one Zachary Thomas Bailey, a fifty year old police officer raped a woman who was on parole three times, the third time she had it filmed so when she reported it he couldn't hit her with with a parole violation in retaliation. The defendant allegedly had to put herself into a scenario where she knew she would be raped again in order to lodge a real complaint against the officer.

If this person is guilty, and with video evidence it looks as if he is, he should go to jail for at least one count of rape.

One of the reasons that I don't think that police officers go to prison is because it is a death sentence. They go to prison on a rape charge and they go in with the rapists, the arsonists, the killers. At best the officers go into solitary until they go insane because the facilities don't exist to adequately house them and this is an enormous barrier for police reform. Sending any officer to jail means that they will probably be tortured, raped, driven insane and murdered if they don't commit suicide first. The fact that we throw people into this environment at all is a discussion for another time, and should be discussed, but I digress. I believe that no matter how vile a person is that they should not be subjected to a prison system that is probably going to torture and kill the offending person.

The fact that police are enormous targets mean that they and certain other high risk offenders should have separate facilities like soldiers do. I believe that it could be done cheaply and rather easily. I believe that sending police to jail for felonies on duty would help restore public trust. I believe that separate facilities would help remove a major barrier to reform and while it isn't the one and only answer, it could be part of a larger comprehensive bill to help effect police reform.

So that is why I believe police officers should go to separate prisons. Change my view.</selfText></submission>

I HOWEVER HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OF ANTI-VAXXERS, AND WOULD LIKE AN ELEGANT COUNTERARGUMENT TO THE ANTI-VAX MOVEMENT AS I AM NOT A DOCTOR.

Here's a summary of anti-vaccine arguments I heard from a teacher at my school many years ago:

1) Vaccination is a 100 year old technology based off of outdated ideas and modern medicine focuses too much on the symptoms of disease and not the underlying cause

2) Most vaccines work by injecting dead or mutated versions of a disease to train the body to fight them, and sometimes contain mercury or preservatives. This cocktail can either spread the disease, fail to prepare the subject for the newly evolved version of the disease, or the mercury and preservatives cause retardation.

Here's what I've heard from the Pro-Vax faction in recent times:

1) The Hurr Durr facts, countries with lots of Polio vaccinations don't have Polio, countries that refuse to use the Polio vaccine have a ton of Polio. Smallpox is extinct, Rubella and the other one I forgot are also gone. Even though I have no medical degree to me it would seem vaccines are a good idea

2) the Anti-Vax arguments are based off the study by precisely one guy who has had his medical license revoked or something like this. This may be an ugly comparison but Galileo was told not to publish anything anymore and put under house arrest for suggesting the veracity of a heliocentric universe and he himself faced a ton of disagreement by 'official scientists.' Of course Europe's governments had theocratic leanings at the time and it was 500 years ago. 


**My view**

Seems like vaccines work, but the idea that they contain mercury and preservatives seems like it is a concern. Obviously that herbalistic nuveau hippy or fundie shit is a death sentence rather than an alternative

All of the other protagonists throughout the series were given a definitive live/ die scenario. Do "X" and earn your freedom, fail to do "X" and die. The only other exception I've seen in the series is movie number four, in which the rules were quite convoluted and obscured, so I think that story was equally fucked, but that one isn't really the subject of this post. I might make that one later.

CMV</title><commentCount>15</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1v94ku/i_do_not_believe_the_us_government_bears/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>Internet activists unfairly blame the US government for causing the death of Aaron Swartz. Ignoring issues of freedom of information and instead focusing on the details of the case, what Swartz did was illegal. He was aware that he was committing a crime, and presumably aware of the legal risk. The potential maximum sentence of 50 years in prison was not an arbitrary number invented by a vengeful judge; rather, it was the sum of the maximum penalties for his charges, determined in full accordance with the law. Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Swartz refused to take a plea bargain for 6 months in minimum security prison. Lacking the funds to defend himself at trial, he succumbed to the pressure and took his own life.

The outrage surrounding Swartz's death focuses on his role as an activist, justification for greater freedom of information, and the "disproportionality" of the potential sentence. It ignores Swartz's obvious guilt and his rejection of the rather "proportionate" 6 month sentence. When determining whether or not the US government bears responsibility for Swartz's death, the latter two issues seem more relevant than the former three. 

The government was doing its job by enforcing its own laws. The activist community prefers to see Swartz as a victim and the US government as a bully because of their admiration of Swartz and because portraying the events in this manner creates greater sympathy and support for their causes.

Brake detail some harrowing case studies showing that many drivers get a pretty easy ride given in comparison to the misery they have inflicted on others. For example

&gt;"A drink driver who killed his schoolboy passenger in an 80mph crash after saying 'I'm wasted' was jailed for only four years, a third of the maximum. Ashley Ogden, 19, gave a lift to 15-year-old Daniel McHugh and a friend. He swerved round a police recovery lorry and shouted 'Come on - chase on!' He later lost control and smashed into a tree and bus stop, killing Daniel. The other passenger suffered a double fracture to his leg, a collapsed lung and broken ribs. Ogden, of Leigh, Greater Manchester, did not have a full licence and was one-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit when tested two hours after the crash. He pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol and failing to comply with his provisional licence terms. (Daily Mirror, 15 November 2005)"

4 years is not a long enough prison sentence.

&gt;"The Star newspaper in Sheffield reported two cases of drivers let off for Causing Death by Dangerous Driving for killing by driving far too fast on bends. In the first case, Christopher Deaken-Frith admitted driving 'much too fast' down a Sheffield hill in frosty weather, ending the lives of his two passengers Liam Oliver and Sarah Kate O'Melia. Police estimated a driver would have been able to negotiate the bend 'with ease' if driving at less than 48mph. The speed limit was 30mph. Relatives stormed out of court when Deaken-Frith walked free with a suspended sentence for Causing Death by Careless Driving. In the second case, Nicholas Boothman crashed on a bend that he took at an estimated 50mph-70mph despite wet conditions and a sign warning drivers to take the bend at no more than 40mph. He killed passenger Robert Shaw, and seriously injured passenger Daniel Hallas, who had to have part of his leg amputated. He too walked free with a suspended sentence for Causing Death by Careless Driving."

No prison sentence at all!?!?! Totally uncool. 

http://brake.org.uk/component/content/article/15-facts-a-resources/facts/497-inadequate-criminal-charges-for-drivers-who-kill-and-maim-through-bad-driving-in-the-uk

I think the Green Party policy on driving is pretty spot on. You test drivers every 5 years to make sure they can drive.

http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/tr.html

Aside from this though I think if you are caught speeding you should be looking at a ban of 12 months no matter what though. It is never acceptable to speed, none of us are driving emergency vehicles that have that type of urgency, nothing you can be planning on doing is worth a human life. 

Again I think if you are caught drunk / on drugs behind the wheel that should be a lifetime ban.

I understand that in the past people relied on cars to get about, that isn't true anymore, almost all parts of the developed world are well served by public transport. Aside from this you forfeit your right to a car when you endanger the safety of others.

The Prime Minister and Government have been trying to have their death sentences reduced as they are due for execution soon. The Indonesian president rejected their pleas for Clemency and I believe that he should not change that decision.

I shall try outline my reasoning here. Firstly, these men knew the punishment for drug smuggling in Indonesia was death, secondly others have already been executed for similar offences. They are only receiving such support because they are Australian citizens, however The Australian government and media have no problem bragging about Australian IS fighters that have been killed. I also believe that my personal moral objections to the death penalty do not outweigh the reasons above. I am still somewhat on the fence about this so I welcome somebody to change my view. 

/u/klparrot said I think the Aussie government should fight to prevent the execution, I don't think it's wrong for Indonesia to go ahead with it. Which I think is a better way of putting my thoughts.

While I have not done any in depth research, everything I have read about his actions to end apartheid are noble. Further, I think his teachings of non-violence following his 27 years of a reportedly violent prison sentence are all the more noble. 

I can't help but think those calling him a terrorist, most of which are conservatives, simply wish to vilify an incredible and popular man because his political views and ideological teachings popularize anti-conservative ideas. 

Can you change my view? Also, feel free to try and reinforce it. </selfText></submission>

CMV</title><commentCount>11</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1fxite/i_am_procapital_punishment_cmv/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>I believe capital punishment is a very fair system, while unpleasant it seems to be a very balanced philosophy in my eyes;

We are all, of course, human and we all equally deserve every right that is bestowed upon humans. We deserve shelter, food, family etc. and of course the right to live. Humans as a species have lasted this long by learning to live with each other and not totally blow each other pieces (for the most part). Within a small society such as a state or indeed a country, an act that opposes this will to live with each other (in my eyes I cannot see this stretching much further beyond murder, torture or perhaps rape) could be deemed 'un-human', and therefore sacrifices their status as a human, and therefore their human-rights to shelter, food, family and then the right to live. 

Now yes, death is as final as anything you'll find on this planet, and if it is to be used it is to only be used carefully. But think of it contractually - you are a human with human rights, but if you make the decision to commit such an act then you are at that moment you commit the act making the decision to admit and accept your punishment. The law would be there and you would know when just thinking about committing murder, the punishment WOULD be death. If, after knowing and acknowledging this, you then choose to commit the act anyway you are accepting the punishment you chose to ignore. 

Yes, I of course see the irony in capital punishment. 'Don't kill or you will be killed' is of course ironic. But the idea is more that if you commit the crime you are accepting a sentence set forth by a law, and the death is the carrying out of that sentence bestowed upon the criminal as an abstract concept and a state of being.

Maybe I make no sense. Probably. But I have long thought this and long had debates with people where I am yet to have my view changed. Part of me would quite like to change this view as it is quite controversial and upsetting to some people, but the logic just pieces together all too well for me to abandon it.

So, by all means, CMV.</selfText></submission>

 And let's be honest they will adjust relative to their surroundings. They will have days where they laugh with their inmate friends out in the yard. They get some luxuries and will get enjoyment out of things no matter how trivial they seem to a free man. Again everything is relative.</selfText></submission>

We could either make one child (or person) happy, or we can pursue a cure so that a future person with that ailment can enjoy a treatment.

As an example, I turn to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  Over [76 million](http://fy12annualreport.wish.org/our-finances/) dollars were given in unrestricted funds to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in 2012.  We could instead donate that money to a group like the American Cancer Society, and [increase their research budget](http://www.cancer.org/research/infographicgallery/where-does-money-go-2012) by about 50%.  Wouldn't it be better to find a cure that can benefit far more people - the ill, their families, and their communities - than giving money to a kid to make a "wish" come true?

I grant that this is a long-term view, but consider an ailment like AIDS.  Thirty years ago it was a death sentence, but we spent money on finding treatments and cures.  Now people with AIDS live long, relatively normal lives, and recent news is hopeful about an actual cure.  If people had focused more an the AIDS patients' happiness, and less on a long-term solution, we wouldn't have made the strides in medicine that allow people with AIDS to continue to function in society.

**TL,DR:  Giving money to make people who are terminally ill is a waste when we could spend that money on trying to find an actual cure.**</selfText></submission>

The only other American spies who got worse sentences than Pollard (and who were not released shortly after imprisonment) are [Robert Hanssen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen) who spied for the USSR and led to "possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history" and [Aldrich Ames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrich_Ames), a CIA employee who sold defense secrets to the USSR leading to the deaths of U.S. agents. 

The worst sentence ever given for selling classified information to an *allied* country (besides Pollard) is 16 years when [William Colton Millay sold military secrets to a Russian spy in 2011](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/william-colton-millay-sentenced_n_3089459.html).

Despite the fact that the crimes Pollard committed were very illegal and compromising to U.S. security, I do not believe he should have gotten the prison sentence he did unless he truly was the worst spy in U.S. history besides Ames and Hanssen.

We put murderers to death because they are extremely dangerous to society and have broken the social contract. I believe the death penalty is not about vengeance, but about protecting the public from truly dangerous people whose harm can only be stopped by removing them from the earth. To be clear, arguably more minor forms of rape, such as statutory, do not fall under what i believe should be capital offense, similaraly to how a murder in the heat of passion may be treated with a prison sentence instead.

Although this definition is not strictly legal, I do side with femanists and law professors who argue that rape is the murder of the soul, and the issue society faces when dealing with rapists is best solved through capital punishment. Just as gangsters have had power to commit murder from inside their cells by sending hit orders through corrupt guards (see: al Capone and tookie Williams) rapists can and will still rape within the walls of a prison (see: US prisons). They premeditaded doing irreversable harm to an individual and carried it out because they thought they could get away. victims of rape often can never psychologically recover and are in a way "killed" on the inside. In many extreme cases, rapists are set in their sick ways and can no longer serve society in any way. Please, cmv.</selfText></submission>

CMV</title><commentCount>8</commentCount><permaLink>/r/changemyview/comments/1zxsb8/i_believe_that_the_state_is_necessary_but_not/?ref=search_posts</permaLink><selfText>(My views here are heavily based on *Better Angels of Our Nature*, by Steven Pinker, and the ideas of Thomas Hobbes, as presented by Pinker. I have not read Hobbes directly.)

**The Hobbesian Trap**

There are four main motives for violence:

1. Predation - You have something I want. I attack you so I can forcibly take it.

2. Preemptive Strike - "Do unto others before they do unto you." If I think there is a chance you will attack me for any reason, then I may gain an advantage if I seize the initiative and attack you first. This can apply even if the reason I think you will attack me is because I think that you think that I will attack you. This, as I understand it, is the Hobbesian Trap.

3. Revenge/Retribution - "Self help justice" I think you have done something against me, whether it be a physical attack, or an insult. I attack you in retaliation. This is tied to deterrence (4). If I maintain a reputation for retaliation, then you may be hesitant to attack me. Revenge is exacerbated by the fact that everyone thinks they are more "in the right" and their enemies are more "in the wrong" than they actually are, leading to escalation.

4. Deterrence - "The best defense is a good offense." I attack you to establish my reputation and strength. This can be retaliation (3), or pre-emptive strike (2).

**Leviathan**

The solution to the Hobbesian Trap is "Leviathan", also known as the state. It can break the Hobbesian Trap in a few ways:

1. Deterrence - By punishing those who act against the best interests of society it makes crime less attractive. It also takes the burden of deterrence off of individuals, which means that their reputation for strength is less important.

2. Breaking the cycle of revenge - By carefully reviewing the details of a case (the judicial process), Leviathan can get an impartial idea of what happened, so that it can give a proportional sentence. Because retribution is coming from a third party, instead of from the individuals in the dispute, there is less incentive to counter-retribution.

3. De-escalation - If I know that you don't have very much incentive to attack me, them I don't have as much incentive toward peremptive strikes, or toward building up my offensive strength.


**Statistics**

According to Steven Pinker, the statistics back up the Hobbesian view of the state and violence. On average, state societies have less war deaths (per capita and as a percentage of all deaths) and a lower homicide rate than stateless societies. (See *Better Angels of Our Nature*, ch. 2 "The Pacification Process", esp. fig 2-2, pg. 49; fig 2-3, pg. 53; and 2-4, pg 55.)

**Caveats**

I am aware that states can and have wrought extreme violence, both on their own citizens and on foreigners. Harassment, brutality, false imprisonment, executions, torture, war and genocide have all come out of states.

Police abuse their power. The judiciary convicts innocent people, not always unintentionally. Laws punish people who are aren't hurting anyone.

But, I believe that, even with those things taken into account, society is, on balance, more peaceful with a state than without.

Please change and/or refine my view.</selfText></submission>

In 1971, Bangladesh won independence against Pakistan after a bloody nine month long war. During the war, three million Bangladeshis were killed and two lakh women were raped. At this very time, a few Bangladesh nationals betrayed their own country and helped Pakistan in this genocide. They killed, raped and looted. They were responsible for attack on minorities. Their atrocities knew no bound. 

Fourty two years later, these people have been brought to trial. Their crimes have started to be accounted for. I believe they all deserve death penalties for their crimes, given that the Bangladeshi constitution has the provision for death penalties and also states that the verdict must be proportional to the crimes committed. I believe so because I feel that no crimes as Bangladesh's should go unnoticed. I feel that the world needs to know about all these crimes and the Bangladeshis deserve at least that. The criminals must be given appropriate verdicts for their crimes against humanity.</selfText></submission>
