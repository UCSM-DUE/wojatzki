comments_watch%3Fv=QkW-0ewjiJw_reordered.txt	-->  User_3 I see your point and this would probably work fine with those three examples, but it sets a dangerous precedent. What constitutes undisputable evidence (for instance)? These people also have the right to appeal their convictions, so there's no real way to simply execute them and save money (they appeal and stay in death row for decades). Ironically, death row inmates cost significantly more money to the state than a regular inmate and so there really isn't even a monetary benefit to the death penalty. I just want to say I agree with the sentiment, maybe they deserve to die. However, there's no real way to carry that out justly.

Here in Texas, we don't even care if they're guilty before we execute them.  There's been at least five in the last 20 years that we're almost certain were innocent. Michael Morton was on death row 25 years before they finally figured out the Williamson County prosecutor was a lying sack of shit hell bent on racking up convictions and let him go.  If they'd had that express-lane thing, they could have just buried the truth along with Mr. Morton and  nobody would been the wiser.  We don't really go for "wise" all that much in Texas.  Makes people feel funny.﻿	DEBATE_STANCE:AGAINST	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	AGAINST	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	FAVOR	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE

If it deters others, good.  Besides the whole argument against it due to lack of deterrence is a biased and false one anyways. You can always point to a capital crime and say, "See? He wasn't deterred". But the number of crimes that were deterred is impossible to know BECAUSE THEY NEVER OCCURRED! I guarantee you one thing though. Any who do receive the death penalty. Never commit any crime ever again.

Death penalty is not murder, it is self defense, society has to defend itself against criminals, executed criminals will never murder again. I'm Italian living & working in Singapore, I love it in Singapore, I admire Singapore's discipline & strict death penalty law for criminals & drug traffickers; as a result Singapore is a free drug society & has low crime rate. Death penalty is truly a deterrent to crime. I wish there was death penalty in Italy.

comments_watch%3Fv=ka1B59ir1mI_reordered.txt	77 User_315 It's amusing how people think the electric chair is inhumane compared to the current method, lethal injection. Brain death occurs almost instantly from the initial shock. No chemicals to measure, no recipes to screw up. One shock and done. The rest is to stop the heart, which is quite the tough little organ. That said, the death penalty has a place. It is more humane by its very nature than locking somebody in a cage, oftentimes alone, for decades on end. I know I'd rather take a bullet than sit in an eight by six box, alone, for fifty years or more. The death penalty and life without parole are the same punishment, one is just immeasurably more cruel.﻿	DEBATE_STANCE:FAVOR	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	FAVOR	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	FAVOR	NONE	AGAINST	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE

comments_watch%3Fv=ka1B59ir1mI_reordered.txt	100 User_339 In america the new and improved death penalty will be a cash cow for the private jails. Death penalty is for the lazy and greedy soon to be the greedy and lazy. We all know the decapitated human body can be kept alive with right equipment for an indefinite amount of time right?. You would need a stockpile of stackable, storage, watertight containers (fema coffins?) that could hold one body plus equipment. You know for the "freshness" factor in the organ harvesting (& other fluid an bits) by the aging elites. Well I would hope its for organs and not just a handy dandy snack in a pack for something else...﻿	DEBATE_STANCE:NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE
