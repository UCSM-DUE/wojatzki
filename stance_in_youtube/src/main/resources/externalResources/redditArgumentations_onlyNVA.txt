Should consider capital punishment is own view personal view is capital punishment should be reserved crimes treason espionage	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
do consider view purpose does capital punishment serve other retribution EDIT information giving studies have read was study someone was be placed death would be spike violent crime	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
do consider view purpose does capital punishment serve other retribution Retribution is accepted part criminal justice know disagree t.T are other arguments such being distinct punishment severe crimes can be situations is added punishment murder everything someone may have done are arguments relating closure victims don't find compelling favor capital punishment sentence serves wide-reaching symbolic purpose example hanging war criminals extend rationale things espionage treason think examples retribution is important	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
first point should cost good thing appeals process is consumes money need be sure is possible putting someone death is true seems think cheaper kill much money is funneled keeping people convicts alive are honest people bottom scraping should someone believed had right end someone elses life take priority good citizen costs more money kill somebody should be asking benefit believes death penalty brings are worth financial cost many hundreds thousands dollars should someone DA believes have right end life convict take priority assisting good citizen	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
is true seems think cheaper is wrong particular point should someone DA believes have right end life convict take priority assisting good citizen think would amend said say DA may believe state has right end life reason prosecuting people takes priority helping good citizen is job sure is being suggested saying take priority assisting good citizen	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
DA may believe state has right end makes choice request death sentence court course court needs agree death sentence is appropriate course can only request death sentence certain crimes can save lives choosing request death sentence is major source racial bias justice system way does believe have right end lives does judge approves death sentence does state statements are conflict another was saying extra money spent imprisoning people killing would be spent good citizen is talking improving education healthcare welfare public transport etc were looking decision national level weren't talking decision gets make should be asking extra money spent killing people imprisoning would be spent good citizen	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
DA makes choice request death sentence court behalf state DA represents government doesn't make decisions vacuum point was description sounded is making personal choice have right kill someone have right influence execution law do possess power kill someone DA holds key charges sentencing might be brought someone done coordination branch government way does believe have right end lives manner speaking sure speaking DA is going claim have right end life have right influence execution law is power doesn't reside individual position power power resides state can do is suggest charges sentences	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
costs more money put someone death give life sentence view is capital punishment is is practical first point doesn't get moral issues budgetary ones Innocent people have been will be put death current system innocent people have been will be sentenced life prison Death penalty cases receive higher legal scrutiny life imprisonment argue are more people will die prison life sentences will be executed	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)

argue think have harmed society longer owes anything housing food medical care nothing Execution is humane locking someone food starve death	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
point is argument is humane isn't argument isn't argument premise is death penalty worst punishment should be applied worst crimes accept true is difference executing imprisoning someone whether accept premise true is irrelevant	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
first point costs extensive legal appeal system have put place shouldn't would be possible reduce cost would be savings example have been proposals fast lane sorts certain cases meet certain threshold evidence would reduce cost cost life sentence cost argument applies other countries world have capital punishment second point would need source accusation knowledge nobody innocent can be proven has been put death capital punishment was reinstated	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
would need source accusation examples are older many are new been people put death proven innocent	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
Wait was asking source wrongful accusations Does has confidence legal system believe people have been put death are guilty	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)

someone were caught camera planting bombs shot theatre was caught red-handed wouldn't have moral objections executing record video evidence does equal accurate criminal conviction is outcome human justice system is accurate will be People have been sent jail DNA evidence turned be inaccurate perfect world could convict criminals moral grounds would say think pragmatic argument is much better argument think moral perspective holds weight think civilized world can agree killing is wrong murder is illegal hold something be strived need have good reason use power government kill someone committing violent crime poses deadly threat someone have sympathy killed police don't see anything can be gained killing someone shackles don't think death penalty is better deterrent life imprisonment don't think death penalty is much crueler punishment life solitary confinement	Death Penalty for heinous crimes (murder, mass murder, rape, child molestation etc.)
