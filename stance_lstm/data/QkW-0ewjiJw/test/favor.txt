0_1	The death penalty should apply only in cases where the evidence could not be disputed in any way . I do not want to waste our tax dollars on keeping a guy like James Homes , Vincent Lee , or the Boston bomber brother alive in prison . We decide not to rehabilitate a dog who rips a mans throat out , we just put them down . Tell me why we shouldn't do the same to humans . ﻿
0_3	but what's the alternative ? Imprisonment is incredibly expensive , especially if it is for life . ﻿

0_10	what if there is video evidence ? and you're 100% certain , can we kill child mass murderers then ? ﻿
0_11	I oppose a State death penalty , but support a market death penalty in cases where guilt is absolutely certain . ﻿
0_14	30 years of torture(prison ) vs death ????? Please kill me . I'll be killing and/or harming your guards either(if I did the crime or not ) way . ﻿
0_15	Your premise is in error . NOT having the death penalty is part of why we allow slipshod courts in the first place . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqCIvLN1ess﻿
0_21	He has a fair point but overpopulation is also a serious epidemic and the death penalty helps with that a lot . ﻿
0_23	My dad just always says that instead of wasting all the money on these crazy people , just put them all on an island and let them kill each other off . Wouldn't waste money and it would be their choice on wether to live or defend themselves . I have never felt like the death penalty was a bad thing , ever . Yes I'm sure some people are innocent , but I just think of the people who are not . I don't think About how it doesn't decline murder rates or crap like that , I think about the fact that we waste this money on them to keep them alive while we could spend it on so much more worthy things . ﻿
0_26	Then lets just not imprison anyone dont want to risk sending an innocent to jail lets just let all the accused murders and rapist and drug dealers out we can prove it 100%﻿
0_28	This guy thinks Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the Boston Bomber should live , he thinks john wayne Gacy should still be alive﻿
0_29	The Death Penatly sometimes needs to be there if someone is just too dangerous . ﻿
0_33	Has anybody heard of an eye for an eye﻿
0_37	I tend to be pro-death penalty ( for both murder and rape ) , but for once I'm seeing a coherent argument against my position . Usually the arguments are about racial bias in the police and legal system , which is a fact , but that would not be solved by getting rid of the death penalty . You'd still have racial bias -- just a bunch of lifelong sentences instead of death sentences . The risk of being wrong is by comparison one which is actually directly related . I won't say I'm fully swayed , but I will say there's a serious amount of stuff in this argument that is worth thinking about . ﻿
0_40	And you want to force me to pay to prison that person ? I pay to get that person out of my neighborhood at the lowest price . Which means get the right guy then put a bullet in his head . You are promoting torture . You are becoming more of a threat than he is .
0_47	seems to me it would have been more humane to kill the dudes than keep them in cages wrongly for 30 yrs﻿
0_49	I support the death penalty . But only for that forensic chemist . ﻿
0_58	If the capital punishment ( death penalty ) is abolished , what is your suggestion for the alternative ? Is life in prison ( psychological and physically affected by being jailed ) , more ethical than the death penalty ? ﻿
0_59	I'm a little surprised by the soft arguments . Seems like the presenter is really arguing for better investigations and trials . To say a bad chemist is a good argument for disallowing the death penalty only leads me to say to protect the chemical analysis process . The basic question is , is the death penalty a suitable penalty ? I think it is . I'd offer up Timothy McVeigh . Any problems in that case ? Probably not so I'm focusing on , is the consequence for his crime , death ? Again , I think it was . ﻿
0_60	The best way to silence arguments against the death penalty ( because the way it's administered is " cruel " ) is to hook up the condemned to an oxygen tube that supplies pure nitrogen . The person will grow sleepy with no symptoms of being oxygen deprived and die very peacefully . And his organs will be free from damage so they can be transplanted . This method was beta tested ( inadvertently ) on a couple of Martin Marietta engineers a while back .
0_64	well said . your the most rational comment here . i dont like the death penalty because i find putting someone to sleep a bit soft if they have done something really really nasty , but i admit there are times it seems ness . i wish the rest of people would think a bit more
0_65	" If death penalty is murder , then imprisonment is kidnapping " - JKM #Korwin ﻿
0_66	Why not ? Killing someone is justified in various instances , self-defense being the most obvious case . Besides , it strikes me as a somewhat benevolent punishment , at least compared to long decades of dependence , indignity and violence at the literal bottom of the society , among its worst . If the punishment is inflicted on a terrorist or a traitor - a quick , " soldier's death " is more dignified than keeping them confined and brainwashed , like some wicked living trophy . Let's face it - life is not the most important value , and if we want the humanity to do more than just live and eat - it should not be .
0_69	Sure , there are situations where mistakes are made , and people get executed unjustly . But this is not an argument for abolishing the death penalty . Accidents happen - sometimes innocent people die in car crashes , but I don't this is a sufficient reason to eliminate motor vehicles . Death penalty is supposed to deter people from committing premeditated murder - not murder in general ( I don't think it should apply to , say , crimes of passion ) . Besides , it tends to be rather uncommon - so , that may be a couple of reasons for the lack of strong correlation .
0_72	Keep the penalty for terrorism﻿
0_75	I didn't see a real argument for complete abolishment there . I completely agree that we should never kill someone who might be innocent , but some crimes really do merit death . The first story the guy shared ? Those 2 boys didn't deserve death , but the guy who actually committed the crime sure did . My position is just that the bar should be raised for death penalty cases . Instead of reasonable doubt , or does the crime merit death , the bar that must be crossed should be zero doubt . The crime was caught on film or in front of a group of many ironclad witnesses . Fewer capital sentences , but not outright abolishment . ﻿
0_76	I'm with you . The problem is not with the punishment , it's with the process .
0_77	abolish ? no restrict ? yes . with modern video and DNA technology , I would say better confirmed cases of mass murder like a mass shooter confirmed on video cameras , ect . should have the option of death penalty , when your face is on the video that they're using as evidence against you , you really can't say " the police screwed up the forensics " and you need to be permanently removed from society through death to end all the trouble you're causing for society . there are people in this world that just need to be removed and forgotten , not going to name names , but I can think of a few . ﻿
0_78	It costs way too much money to keep someone in prison for life . ﻿
0_83	I said the whole system needs to be reformed in order to lower the costs . Transitioning to firing squads was just one of the reforms .
0_93	" I support the protection of life from conception to natural death . But a natural death for a murderer is a death on the gallows . " - JKM #Korwin ﻿
0_102	explain to me how the death penalty is more expensive than life sentences not including the ridiculous appeal process the US has , causing decades long stints on death row .
0_104	if there is concrete evidence that shows they did it , like video showing them committing the crime , I would be inclined to usually say yes , but I would agree to a single appeal . also , you didn't answer my question , which I asked first and that you replied with another question ...... that's downright rude .
0_106	" When they execute someone in China they charge the family for the bullet . The death penalty also costs much more than housing people for long periods of time so do you want to foot that bill ? "
0_119	Here is the problem . This video only shows examples of people incorrectly sentenced to death . What about the people who ARE guilty of crimes that are currently deemed worthy of the death penalty ? What is the reason to spare them ? ﻿
0_123	So you think locking another human being in jail for the rest of their life is more humane ? It's not about moral superiority , because morals are simply not important to those who ignore them .
0_124	I would rather have latter system . Sparing the guilty results in the harm of more innocents . Yes the justice system can fail sometimes , but it by nature does not intentionally harm the innocent .
0_125	Very convincing , although I'll continue further research into this ongoing topic before I fully alter my mindset toward the death penalty . I've been an ardent believer in swift execution for the the atrociously worst convicted offenders , perhaps it's time I evolved . ﻿
0_127	that idiot chemist needs to be put to death . ﻿
0_131	How can killing innocents be worse than jailing innocents if value is subjective ? ﻿
0_133	You're right , I was a little off topic . I wrote it quickly ... But the latter part of my post holds true . Decisions are relative , so whatever number you output from your formula needs to be compared to something . When C = 0 , that quantifies value AFTER the person is dead . A person who is deciding if death is better than current conditions must then quantify their life BEFORE they die , which means C = 1 , thus all other values matter . If that output is less than 0 , then death is a step up . If you prevent death to such a person , then you're prolonging their suffering .
