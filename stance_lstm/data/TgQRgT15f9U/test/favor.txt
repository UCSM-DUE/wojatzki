funny how extremist liberals like hillary clinton and BO are all for the death penalty when it comes to abortion ( even third trimester as the baby is being delivered ) , but they're vehemently against the death penalty for known killers , go figure ! ﻿
Society is like a house , when you don't take out the trash it becomes unlivable . If you're too crazy to understand that murder is wrong I see that as MORE of a reason to remove you from the earth . ﻿
In New Hampshire public hangings are still legal . Live free or die . God bless New Hampshire . ﻿
California can learn a thing or two from TEXAS .... ﻿
All , and I mean all , nygurs and muslims need to be executed immediately . That may seem harsh but it's nothing compared to what they are hell bent on doing to everyone else . And by everyone else , I mean humans . ﻿
Does the Death Penalty prevent murder ? Well ... I have yet to see one murderer who ever received the Death Penalty ever commit another murder , ever again . So ... Yeah .
Or any other crime for that matter . Rehabilitation rate for Death Penalty is 100% . No one who has received it ever commits ANY crime ever again .
That is the sad truth about California . It don't care bout the death penalty , all it cares bout is convictions . Now the prison systems are running out of places to put people ........ my guess is if they would use the death penalty they wouldn't have that problem .... but I am for it . I believe there are some sick and twisted people that just need to go﻿
A Sizeable portion of Prison space in Texas , New Mexico , Arizona ... is taken up with Out of state Prisoners from California . California pays other states to house their overcrowding .
seems kind of stupid to do that doesn't it ? If the death penalty was used , and not just a threat , then thing would b better off
All of California would be better off if they'd just kick the Liberals the hell out of power .
y not go and get rid of everyone and start from scratch
I hope you're being facetious . Otherwise that statement is just too fucking stupid to comment on . I'll leave it to you to figure out why . If you can .
yeah , the recent escape of multiple known murders in States that don't institute the death penalty actually proves it needs to be expanded in all States and followed through with in a timely manner in cases where it's absolutely known the perpetrator actually did commit the crime .
The only reason why the death penalty wouldn't be a deterrent because the murderers are not afraid or convinced by it . Some murderers may even want to die , but in a way that they could suddenly wreak havoc for their own selfishness . The Constitution doesn't allow " cruel and unusual punishment " , and I bet a lot of us would implement such ! ﻿
So logically , if a murderer is afraid to die , then why would he replicate that fear on those he harms ? Only at the point where you forfeit your life completely do you realize that other lives are forfeit as well . That's the tried-and-true pathology of any common murderer and I'm talking about the premeditated kind and not the passionate . If you don't think I have common sense , then you know nothing about our crime and punishment system and probably should be recused from participating in civic duty in that regard , due to " incompetence " .
It's not so much about deterrence as it is insuring that animal never has a chance to commit further crimes ever again . If it deters others , good . Besides the whole argument against it due to lack of deterrence is a biased and false one anyways . You can always point to a capital crime and say , " See ? He wasn't deterred " . But the number of crimes that were deterred is impossible to know BECAUSE THEY NEVER OCCURRED ! I guarantee you one thing though . Any who do receive the death penalty . Never commit any crime ever again . In that regard it has a 100% success rate .
I never believed in the death penalty , until I watched a lot of true crime stories . Instead of paying $ 30,000 to $ 60,000 a year to keep these death row types alive , I say give the people they offended a choice ! And , make them work ! Some definitely deserve it , and some do not . One woman because a very good person , but sorry to say Bush had to go with the law . I felt badly for her . I do not want innocent people to die ... some are in there wrongly , thank goodness DNA came along .
If you knowingly kill someone , you have violated society's laws and you deserve to die , abortion doctors AND criminals . Both are just as crazy and equally guilty of murder . Killing an infant inside or outside makes no difference , its still alive . Btw , texas is republican dominated , and ron white has right wing ideas , so yes , this was intended to push right wing policies
Hell yeah ! Gotta love Texas :)
All the Blue Collar comedians are real men !
Ron White is a REAL MAN !
You're right . A civilized society deals with the people who violate one another's right to live . And that means , you shackle ' em in and flip the switch .
I say , you violate someone else's right to live , you have given up yours . In my book , you deserve to be shot in the face on the spot .
Absolutely true ! They want to keep a murderer alive on our tax dollars . But they won't even give an unborn child a chance at life outside the womb ! That my friend is hypocracy at it's worst ! This is the main reason Social Security is going down the tubes ! We have exterminated an entire generation through Roe V . Wade !
God Bless Texas !
Liberals are absolutely KILLING our country . Do I believe we should aid those we can't do it for themselves ? Yes , but there are too many holes in system so that homegirl gets to use hers lone star card while sending a txt on her iPhone .
You never see massacres down here ! Screw liberals !
Wooohooo !!!! Lets go republican states !!!!
this is not complicated at all - for RAPE , PREMEDITATED MURDER , CHILD ABUSE , SELLING DRUGS you should be put on trial , you should be granted an appeal - then if found guilty , you should be taken downstairs in the court building , that day and terminated . Enough of this happy horseshit - time to set standards and maintain them in every state , every day .
" Hey guys , we found the guys that plotted the attacks on 9/11 what should we do ? " " Eh , put them in this jail cell , we'll give them free food and pay our money to keep them alive . " " Oh ok , that sounds like a good plan ! "
you liberals are the ones who are backward idiots .
whatever you jack ass
no , we use an electric chair or a firing squad , they get to choose .
True . My adds is rather than wasting a bullet/injection or cleaning that cell of you mentioned . Just recycle them , ie : live harvest ALL useful bits on their body and sell it to the highest bidder . Maybe then the pathetic government can pay off some of its debts .
Luv Ron White . Wish we have death penalty and a harsher system in Australia . Its totally pathetic . Serious criminals doesn't get what they deserve , especially if you are rich . And something minor and you happens to be poor then they are ruined by the lengthy red tape court system .
Regarding the death penalty : Pros : 1 . Prevents criminals from escaping/being released to commit more crimes . 2 . Closure for grieving families . 3 . Taxpayers don't have to pay to sustain the lives of criminals . Cons : 1 . Too harsh for some crimes ( obviously wouldn't do it to a mere petty thief ) . 2 . Not harsh ENOUGH for others - let rapists starve in a single cell PACKED with other rapists . Nothing is cut-and-dried ; this is not a decision to make lightly .
Not really , you can go buy 100 pack of . 40 caliber bullets at wal mart for less than 30 dollars and still have some left over . If this country would treat criminals like criminals they wouldn't have the overcrowding problem . And on a personal note , I would not lose one nights sleep over putting a bullet in the heads of the guys who murdered my father .
Canada is dumb . How can you not kill someone who has killed a child . I would do it myself without a second thought .
The death penalty ensures the cretin doesn't do it again .
i like your usename . your not for the death penalty , yet you wish death upon us all with cancer . Hypocrite
Why is the discussion about it not being a deterrent even had . No , it's not a deterrent ... so f-ing what ... IT IS A PUNISHMENT !!! I could not give a damn about it's effectiveness as a deterrent . That NEVER should have been the point .
I just think that if you maliciously take another human being's life ( that doesn't include self-defense ) , yours is forfeit . What gives you the right to keep on living when you've taken someone else's life away ? And I feel the need to specify that that's a rhetorical question , beause every person peacefully expressing their opinion gets attacked on the internet .
I would bet that in Texas , the bad guy might of only got off a couple of shots before the redneck theatre-goers returned fire . God help the Aurora injured , Rest in Peace the Aurora dead . God Bless Texas .
With the death penalty I can GUARANTEE you that your children will NEVER be molested , raped , killed or kidnapped by the bad guy . I know you cannot guarantee anything with rehab . I believe in making sure that our kids have the best chance . It's just a difference of opinion on how to handle people who wish to kill your children .
They are rehabilitated . Let's have them babysit your children ?
We could let them be YOUR roommates . I would rather kill those same people .
i bet if the movie theater massacre happened in Texas , John Holmes will get the death penalty and we all know that Texas loves to kill it inmates that are on death row . Ron's so right about our death penalty . Texas Pride .
I understand compassion and what you believe in but when peole see you kill someone for no good reason , there's gonna be consequences . You kill 2 or more and we should end you before you end us . The sad laws of basic survival : kill or be killed .
I want to kill murderers , child molesters and the like . you want to keep child molesters and rapists alive . You want to keep the theatre killer alive ? I want to chop him up ( kill him ) . I am clearly a scumbag . Lol .
i know i'm late to the argument .... but the bible specifically has punishment for things like murder . Multiple felons are sentenced to punishments based on their transgression . So using " christianity " as a reason to not have a death sentences is self defeating .
For a punishment to be an effective deterrent , it must be carried out in more than a few cases and in a timely manner . I know that if I kill someone in most states , I have a very high chance of never receiving the death penalty . And even if I do , I could probably appeal my way out of it . If we actually used the death penalty ( and it took less than 45yrs to get it done for people who are sentenced to it ) , trust me , it would become a deterrent .
Every state should have the " express lane " .
It may not be " foolproof " but it takes a lot of sickos out of this world who don't diserve to contnue living because they have killed multiple people FOR NO REASON . Pro death penalty
That explains why you didn't directly reply to me . How backwards are you ? Having the death penalty would still be cheaper because there would be relatively less prison guards needed on payroll , since they'll just kill the prisoners anyway . Prosecution costs are cheaper than that of meals and guards . Law enforcement cost would remain the same , as all that's changing are the consequences of crimes , not cop behavior . Legal protection would only rise a bit in the short run . Long run , still cheaper
They are illogical because they make no sense whatsoever . The human body needs about 2000 calories per day , and with an evergrowing population , food costs more and more . You are trying to convey that somehow , by some inane possibility , feeding a large amount of prisoners , 3 times a day , for 365 days a year , is somehow cheaper than purchasing a stock of cyanide that would only need to be used once for these prisoners . The cost is high , but in the long run , it is cheaper . You really are an idiot .
" Every study shows a bias against minorities AND it's more expensive to impose the death sentence than life in prison . " I can't even begin to describe how illogical that sounds . You're an idiot .
We can't let the murderer out because he killed ( hypothetical ) your daughter . If we let him out , he might kill your wife . We can't leave him in prison for life , that's cruel . We can't kill him , that's cruel . The truth is .... We CAN kill him , to get rid of him ... to send a message to others . It's the best choice . I don't want to kill anyone but more important than my emotions is ...... the need to rid the planet of this horrible person . A baby was just born . Kill the killer before he finds the baby
