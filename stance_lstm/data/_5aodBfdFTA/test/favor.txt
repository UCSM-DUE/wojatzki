3_405	The U.S. Justice Dept are pushing for the death penalty re the Charleston Church shooting . Lets hope they get it , if they do it will send a message to any other murdering fukkers . ﻿
3_406	Idiot Ian Islop says dont have the death penalty just in case the person being executed is innocent . Ok then lets take Ian's argument even further : Lets REALEASE EVERYBODY IN PRISON JUST IN CASE THEY ARE INNOCENT , RIGHT ? WRONG !!!!! ﻿
3_408	What about the ones that are guilty ? They dont get the death penalty either . Bring back capital punishment NOW !!
3_409	Hey idiot go learn how to read . I said '' LETS TAKE HISLOPS ARGUMENT EVEN FURTHER AND REALEASE EVERYBODY FROM PRISON JUST IN CASE THEY ARE INNOCENT '' . NOT IAN HISLOP SAID LETS RELEASE EVERYONE FROM PRISON . You need reading lessons . Also forget about god . Hes forgotten about you . Instead start concentrating on what matters , like the victims of serious crime . GO VOTE TO BRING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT , LIKE I DID . THEN GO TO READING CLASSES . IDIOT !!! LOL !!!!
3_410	Harriet Harmen is only concerned about capital punishment in case her husband gets the death penalty for claiming expenses on his porno collection ( he tried to claim money back via his wife for his collection of porno material ) This just goes to show you must NEVER believe a thing this woman says . In view of that I now trust you will all vote to bring back capital punishment right ?? ﻿
3_411	Some idiot left a comment saying capital punishment does not work in any way . It works in the Most important way of all . It stops the fuckers from going out and killing some other poor so and so . so BRING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NOW !!!!!!!! ﻿
3_412	I'd vote for the death penalty tomorrow . ﻿
3_416	Hey retardo , several times I have asked you whats wrong with '' revenge '' . Still you dont give an answer . Probably because you dont have one . Also , it was YOU that gave that 88 percent figure to ME ( I sent you the actual comment where YOU stated the 88 percent statistic ) not me to you . So in summing up : I say you are completely clinically mental . And should be sectioned under the Mental Health Act . I am still analysing your comments to see if you are actually a danger to society . If I feel you are I should really notify the authorities . I probably will anyway . Keep an eye out for men in white coats and straight jackets .
3_417	of course there should be a death penalty . Its a no brainer . ﻿
3_418	AS MANY AS POSSIBLE I HOPE !!!!
3_433	Take a life , forfeit your own . The only way for a safe society . Denise Bulger agrees . How would you feel if it were your child ? ﻿
3_434	No answer from Daniel Ryan , another one who disregards Bible teaching and wants murderers let loose on our streets . Perhaps he should consider that God wants a safe society for us all , that God is interested in the victims not the perpetrators of crime .
3_436	We are discussing capital punishment which is scriptural . If you want to discredit me , prove otherwise . You won't be able to . Jesus was concerned with the Old Testament , he often referred to it and said He came to fulfill the law and the prophets . I wouldn't dismiss the OT if I were you . I think you'll find the NT says ALL scripture is inspired by God , and this was before the NT was in existence . Now , tell us , what comes before forgiveness ?
3_438	It seems , as it says in Romans 2 ( New Testament ) that you may be guilty of what you accuse others , twisting the bible to suit your own agenda ? Capital punishment is scriptural . God says it , not I . See my post 6 May which explains why executioners of the state do not commit murder . " Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death " .... Exodus 21.12 . God says it , not I . I am staying on topic , which is - capital punishment .
3_455	... and the ones against it think that a rapist , murderer etc etc must not die ! Really ... lets protect the monsters of this world , and keep them alive . Weak people ! Lets continue to overcrowd prisons so that taxpayers can pay for their meals , and accomodation etc etc .... get a grip﻿
3_465	In my opinion , death penalty is a justified punishment for people found guilty of severe crimes like mass killing , torturing and raping , assuming the person perpertrating these crimes was of a sound mind at the time of these crimes and shows no signs of regret or improvement ... Death penalty acts like a perfect deterrent and prevents such a person from offending again .... ﻿
3_466	I think the death penalty should be reinstated . Because when a criminal takes away the victims freedom then why should the criminal deserve a life when he has taken away someone else's life .
3_468	Terrorists like members of the IRA , ISIS , etc should be put before a firing squad & shot or sent to the gallows , just like in the old days . William Joyce was a British Nazi traitor who was hung for treason in WW2 . Chopping heads off of a Syrian soldier isn't on . ﻿
3_470	I would maintain that execution , if not as a deterrent , functions as a prevention mechanism : even if perhaps applicable only to subjects with explicit goals of future murder who seem immune to rehabilitation .
3_471	I cannot agree with " life in prison solves it " - because from almost any angle , it clearly doesn't solve it ( and in an alarming number of cases makes things worse ) .
3_478	bring back death p for the fucking leftists﻿
3_483	criminals can get away with murder , vandalism , harrasement vandalism etc etc etc﻿
3_491	, rubbish look at countries where they carry out capital punishment , murdes are low
3_497	In cases of murder , rape , paedophilia , and treason ( including terrorism ) the death penalty should be available to the jury in exceptional cases﻿
3_503	! } Nobody cares if its a deterrent or not . 2 ) It costs more ? Yeah right . A murdering fucker stays in jail for 50 yrs and that's cheaper than him being hanged ? 60 seconds ? I think you need maths lessons . ( 3 ) Cut the death row time . Problem solved . ( 4 ) Some murderers are in prison and we KNOW they did it . No guessing . No hearsay . No supposition . THEY DID IT ! HANG THE FUCKERS !!! (5 ) YOUR GUILTY OF BEING A DICK HEAD ( Just thought you needed reminding again sorry )
3_506	Yes but what about the ONES WHO WERE PROVEN THEY DID THE MURDERS YOU STUPID CUNT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3_512	, and how about the cold blooded murders are they not monsters
3_516	She's awesome and hot and capital punishment , God willing , will come back to the UK one day . ﻿
3_523	Not that I support death penalty , but I am surprised that people who debate in favour of it in the video failed to point out that death penalty would actually prevent the crime from happening in the first place which would rule out innocent victims . I think that would have been the most obvious argument against those who oppose capital punishment due to the potential of sending someone innocent to the death row . ﻿
3_525	Talk about a proper deterrent ... ¬_¬
3_533	Murder is the premeditated , cold blooded killing of the innocent.so if the Birmingham 4 Guildford 6 would of be given the death penalty you are saying the government has murdered them , well done
3_536	It amazes me that so many woolly minded liberal arseholes are still preaching that capital punishment was never a deterrent to murder . Well I beg to differ ! As a kid growing up in 50's Britain the knowledge that an execution was taking place had a profound effect on our young impressionable minds , as indeed did the threat of the cane ! Of course it didn't work for everyone , but any deterrent is better than non at all as we are now discovering . ﻿
3_538	Does this prove a correlation between the two ? Who can say for sure ? The only thing we can say with any certainty is that statistical data alone cannot win the argument for either side . Which brings me back rather nicely to its deterrent value on young , impressionable minds . As it was to me in the 1950's .
3_542	Bullshit . The endless appeals are the reason why it costs more . Why on hell will you wait an average of 11 years to put down the murderer ?
3_550	yeah and you've been in solitary confinement it seems . There are thousands of people in solitary confinement across the United states , some only get out for 1 hour or less a day . None kill themselves , even the most cold blooded gang banger . yet the liberals will be the first to kill themselves when put in this situation , yeah fucking right . When you are in that situation and realize what it means to end your existence forever you wouldn't go through with it . Even the survivors of suicide , specifically people who jump from the golden gate bridge came to this realization . you guys live in a fantasy world .
3_561	if you want to talk about death penalty , I think it clearly should be legal because people have a right to support who they want to live and not live ....
3_563	Tony Blair abolished the death penalty for treason . I wonder why ? Did he know something we didn't ? The fact is that it MUST be reintroduced . Our country is currently heaving with seditious vermin who are members of a global child raping slaving cult . The filthy vermin in the mosques and their fanatical followers teach one thing ; that they have an OBLIGATION to lie to , undermine , subvert , subjugate and enslave ALL other people . N o-o ne ANYWHERE in the world is safe living near or amongst vermin who regard them and their daughters as prey . WHEREVER Muslims are in numbers they become increasingly violent ALWAYS . ﻿
3_565	Clearly none of these peoples children have been raped or murdered , if they had im sure there woul be a different saying in the audience . ﻿
3_570	If a member of my family touched up a kid then ye , take his/her head clean off
3_573	Capital punishment can be a deterrent , but that is not it's purpose . It's purpose is to get rid of scum and provide closure to families . Having said that , murder is not always a crime ; it depends on whether the person deserves it or not . ﻿
3_575	I would love to execute them myself ! It would be a dream job , coming up with all the methods and everything ! Boiling , acid , human microwave , oh and you gotta have some scientific testing as well , at least to get some use out of them .
3_579	uk needs to bring back the death penalty in extreme cases . ﻿
