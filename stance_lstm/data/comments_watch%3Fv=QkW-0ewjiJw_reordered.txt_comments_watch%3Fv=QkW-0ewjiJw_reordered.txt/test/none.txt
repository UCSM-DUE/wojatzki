locking up someone for thirty years is injustice. The person can't get back the time that they've lost in prison. No amount of money is able to compensate that.﻿
but what's the alternative? Imprisonment is incredibly expensive, especially if it is for life.﻿
Ostracize them. If they give consent, tattoo their crime across their forehead, take their bio-metrics and add them to a blacklist describing their crimes and then let them back into the community. If they don't agree to that I'm sure members of the community will gladly show them the way out of town and warn surrounding communities of the threat headed their way. To be shunned by friends, family and community in addition to every employer turning them away is a punishment worse than death in many ways.
that's actually pretty good. That'd keep anyone from committing crimes any day. And if there's been a mistake, at least it's easier to clean up than a death penalty.

Intriguing. What do you imagine that market death penalty system would look like?
"We can't compensate for [mistaken executions] the way we do with mistaken imprisonment." Oh, I didn't realize the government had a magic time machine they used to give back the years lost to people mistakenly imprisoned. This video has the feel of something a pre-teen would argue. Logic-less. Inane. Not at all academic. There are plenty of good arguments both for and against capital punishment. This video makes a mockery out of them all. Like it's a poor Saturday Night Live skit mocking Learn Liberty. Truly disappointing.﻿
or you could just notmbe an idiot and not get involved in shady shit.﻿

Getting rid of the death penalty isn't going to save people from being wrongfully imprisoned. You might want to find a better argument.﻿
Carlos Hernandez was guilty, Carlos de-Luna was the innocent one in that case﻿
The Sweet Death Penalty http://www.gosto.org/#DeathPenalty﻿
Of course the death penalty isn't a deterrent. It takes 20 to 30 years to be put to death. The news doesn't report a murder that is soon followed by a trial and execution. The only time the media reports an execution, you can be sure that the crime and trial happened decades earlier. The threat of execution just isn't real enough. It's like the threat of dying from cancer 30 years down the road isn't real to a smoker. If you died months after smoking, not a single person would smoke (unless they had a death wish).﻿
WHO WILL PROTECT THE PUBLIC WHEN THE POLICE/GOVERNMENT BREAK THE LAW!!! "FUCK THE WORL AND THE GOVERNMENT TOO"﻿
You guys realize people have reasons why they do the things they do. Understanding is key to fighting wrong doing.﻿
the problem is with the investigation not the punishment.﻿
Maybe he made a mistake. It's not like he would have done his job differently if there was no death penalty. It just means that his fallibility has graver consequences.
It wasn't "a" mistake. It was THOUSANDS of "mistakes", again and again and again. Except strangely the "mistakes" only gave false positives, never false negatives.
This was the worst and most biased video I have see from learn liberty. The whole video was a display of the injustice in a justice system. It made no arguement for liberty. Only that the "justice system" did not provide justice two individuals and there was no discussion of liberty.﻿
you could make this argument about any legal action﻿
Life sentences?
The point is Gov't can't be perfect. It can't even be " good "Throwing money to the issue won't solve anything. Better Training, more money, better infrastructure, more money, asking the second most death-friendly country (China) for help, etc. Won't ever be perfect. With stakes as high as... you know... life running risks isn't smart, but criminal. ... unless of course, you are a fan of Russian Roulette.
Well... no civilized, free nation, at least...
Haha! If you're going to use an objective definition you'd have to execute all of the CIA and most of the former presidents.
I can imagine government gradually widen the definition of terrorism to make use of it.
It costs way too much money to keep someone in prison for life.﻿
Lethal injections are more efficient and quicker than firing squads? Are you serious?
sure, getting shot is rarely an instant painless death. In  the military, when someone is executed by firing squad they almost never die instantly and have to suffer until someone puts the final bullet in their head.
out of the $250M, how much do you think California can save by using firing squad?
I said the whole system needs to be reformed in order to lower the costs. Transitioning to firing squads was just one of the reforms.
Hey, I'm going to have to write a paper for a basic philosophy class about the death penalty. We are STRONGLY encouraged to frame the argument in the idea of retributism . Both of these arguements had failed to hold against the concept of retributivism, can anyone please explain why it's wrong in that sense?﻿
The very error is in the name - "Penalty". Prisons should be a means of isolating dangerous people to protect the rest of society, not punishment. It's a huge waste of human capital that could benefit the population if instead of providing prisoners with the goods they need to survive they just required them to provide for themselves by getting a job inside prison.﻿
Those people should not be punished, they should be responsibilized. A lot of people talk of "paying the debt to society", how is sitting your ass in a jail cell for months or years supposed to pay debts of any sort?
I respectfully disagree. The whole point of a justice system is the enforcement of necessary moral and legal norms. Punishment of crime is necessary for the maintenance of those norms. On the subject of using prisoners labors for a social good, I find that to be a dehumanizing and demeaning argument. To do so would be to treat prisoners as means to a social end rather than ends in themselves. We must respect their humanity by holding them accountable for their crimes, not use them as tools for our convenience.
You would prefer vigilante justice and revenge to official and impartial justice? Are you confused?
Deprivation of liberty as penalty for violating the rights of your innocent fellow citizen.
The narrator is wrong.  Government doesn't make just a few mistakes.﻿
Meanwhile in Europe... PS: Excluding Belarus.﻿
One limiting factor on guilt and innocence are the terms. We only have words for two cases (guilt and innocence). Since these terms apply only to the results of a court case there are actually four cases. 1. Truly guilty - actually did it and convicted. 2. Truly innocent- actually didn't do it and not convicted. 3. Falsely guilty - actually didn't do it but convicted (worst case) 4. Falsely innocent - actually did it but not convicted We need words for the last two cases to have a clearer discussion on these topics.﻿
they do all that for life sentence trials....
no they don't.
This would be a more convincing argument if he had examples of people who were exonerated post mortem.  Had the individuals mentioned been instead sentenced to life in prison, the story would have been the same - being on death row didn't affect the outcome in these cases.  If anything, people dug harder to find the truth.  Would they still be in prison had they not been on death row?  Maybe, maybe not.  I'm not arguing the death penalty here, merely pointing out that this argument is also lacking.﻿
What does the Bible say? Because nothing else really matters.﻿

So should we be killing off half our population so they wouldn't suffer anymore? There are people who would rather live and suffer than to die and end their suffering.
What?!?
good arguement from a individual and group level﻿
China executes less total people than the US, doesn't that say something about us?﻿
Very convincing, although I'll continue further research into this ongoing topic before I fully alter my mindset toward the death penalty. I've been an ardent believer in swift execution for the the atrociously worst convicted offenders, perhaps it's time I evolved.﻿
Just because you evolve, doesn't mean you are better than where you were before. You may well be, but it is not a given.
that idiot chemist needs to be put to death.﻿
I hope you see the irony in your comment.
it's not ironic b/c it's not gonna happen.

And that is an argument for euthanasia. There, I'll agree with you.
Euthanasia of inmates? You agree with that?
Well, I wasn't thinking about them. But I guess everyone has the right to choose when to die.
