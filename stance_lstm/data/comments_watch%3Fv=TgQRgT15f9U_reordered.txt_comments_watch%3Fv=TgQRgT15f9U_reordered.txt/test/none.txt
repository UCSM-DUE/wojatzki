LMAO﻿
when you record off the tv make sure to check the volume and hold the camera still﻿
Instead of shooting them in the leg, tap their shoulder and say "excuse me".﻿
I fucking hate California...﻿
I moved to Calif (Oceanside). My husband was in the Marines. Instead of my name, "Elaine"...they always called me "Texie." I felt awkward the entire time I was there.....I just didn't fit in too well. I was so glad to get back to Ft. Worth, TX
Most boring state in the U.S. Hell I'd rather live in Alaska
i think people who feel the need to record something off of a tv screen and post it on youtube require the death penalty....﻿
read what rebel born wrote...﻿
And somehow is the most powerful country in the world. It's okay to be jealous. 'Merica
"I motioned the bartender to meet me in the Liquor Room." - From that sentence on I expected gay porn to break out.
More like having individual freedoms, no state income tax, affordable living, and most importantly, a governor who is not a complete libtard idiot buffoon.  I would move to TX in a heartbeat if I could. CA is a nightmare. I know people who live there who want out desperately.
Texas beats the shit out of Cali. And I have family in Cali.
It is just the complex phenomenon of the mind or involuntary reaction of notions.﻿
If people are that sane why have a death penalty and a prison too. It is just there in the society and hard to know why.﻿
"'Who's shooting me in the leg?'" I wonder quietly to myself. "Oh, that guy." POW! Never turn around.﻿
Don't place the blame, son. It's easy that way, but it ain't honest.﻿
does anyone know if aggressive death penalty laws prevent murder or is it difficult to say since Texas probably always had the death penalty? ﻿
they have been on a roll the last few years!!﻿
They always execute people before an election.
In Utah you can still bee killed by firing squad﻿
Why be so quick? Seems the POS needs a little personal treatment, maybe two to three weeks worth.
Mark, bet you would not say that to duck's face! Coward. Or, maybe even to mine, and I'm an old Tea Party person who once was a Democrat, till they started killing babies legally.
Damn! He's good! "I wonder quietly to myself."
abortion doctors give a great service by keeping the human population under control.
Only in texASS!
We have the death penalty and we USE it.
Liberal this liberal that. You dittoheads all sound the same. I love Ron White, but I don't think this bit was intended as some kind of fanatical right wing mandate. Wow, you people are morons.
hope you can reach that goal. I understand.
Are you sure they're innocent because most of them aren't.
So freakin' good, I've got tears :D
what in texas hey hang people ?
My condolences. I can not a imagine how awful you must. feel. We may not agree on a lot of things, but this is at least a billion times bigger then politics.
Well bless your heart.
yep, that too is also true, we Texans love our guns.
People would have more confidence in death penaly convictions if prosecutors,judges or police officers were EVER charged for misconduct.
He's a comedy genius... But, as for the comments. Just FYI... If someone is against the death penalty, that doesn't mean that that person loves criminals or is a pussy or is a disease. Not saying that there isn't a debate to be had... Just don't single people out as pussies.
wins! DING DING! KO
im glad im TEXAN
