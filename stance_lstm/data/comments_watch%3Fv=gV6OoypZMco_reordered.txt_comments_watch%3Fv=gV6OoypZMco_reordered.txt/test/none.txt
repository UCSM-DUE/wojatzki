There are FAR worse things you can do to someone than kill them . Ian Brady convicted serial child killer in the UK has been serving a whole life tariff since 1966 . He has come to the realisation that he is better off dead so he is on hunger strike . He is currently being force fed . I hope he lives to 100 - 23 years to go ! ﻿
Some people are beyond redemption . ﻿
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . ﻿
zzzzzzz
dont attack them they made it for a debate class and the video does not reflect their personal views
well thats the point isnt it ? they're not going to show them doing good shit are they ? its because they committed a crime ..... and what should the victims look like ? hardcore cunts ? sounds silly really doesnt it ?
condemned *
If anyone knows the name of the song please let me know ? c : ﻿
Karma Police -Radio Head
nice this helped me in school :D ﻿
I think John Floyd Thomas Jr. was sentenced to life in prison without parol not the death penalty . i am not sure tho ! ﻿
As disgusting as it is , should all rape be considered in the same terms as the taking of life ? I doubt it .
For all you people out there not aware of the political situation in other countries . Several Southeast Asian countries have the death penalty for non-murder related charges such as drug trafficking . And people think U.S.A is harsh . SMH﻿
But , yet the U.S has the 5th Highest Execution Rate , in the World . Nobody said the U.S was the most Inhumane Country . But you're leaving out the fact that many other Countries do have a better Human Rights Record than America does : The Falklands , Argentina , Canada , Greenland , Australia , New Zealand , & almost every single Country in Europe , undoubtedly has a better Human Rights Record than America does .
Liked the video and the song by Radio Head was perfect . ﻿
America ain't civilized in your opinion
Personal attacks instead of a counter argument ? Excellent tactic ! :p
None of those countries have it either .
You should be happy with how Ramirez died seeing as you like gruesome painful executions . Cancer is far crueler than any execution method on the books .
As far as I'm aware , Eric Casseus was not sentenced to death - he actually faced 5-15 years in prison . He maintained his innocence as well .
Death Penalty = Easy way out . Simple .
The government already does murder people you dumb twat have you ever heard of the military ?
Jerry's mug shot on this clip was from his time in Memphis when he was drunk and armed outside Graceland , yelling for Elvis to come outside .
Where did WALLFLOWERxiii get their information on Jerry Lee Lewis getting the death penalty for drug trafficking ? In 2012 he married his cousin's ex-wife and is living in Mississippi , not on death row . I can find very little to no information on his life of crime but what I have found is very disturbing , ie : killing grand jury witnesses , deputy sheriffs , police informants , etc . Why is this old " Killer " still free ?
Was wondering what's the song " s name :)
the best part of this video was the song . <3 Radiohead
To those monsters , I say good riddance .
Yes , good , appeal to emotion , that'll prove your moral argument .
ok guy at 1:43 lol wtf is that about ? did he use the child as a shield , and the police shot the child ? or did they murder him just for using the child as a shield , and no one was hurt ? that would be pretty stupid if the police accidentally shot the child trying to shoot the robber . and all for what ... money ? money that the police officer has no involvement in ? money that would've been easily replaced by the bank rofl . good judgment call bro , thats why u make the big bucks .
Make special prisons for the most heinous of offenders . Not unlike Auchwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka . We have too many people making a life out of getting in jail , too many people loving a thug lifestyle and golifying crime . Give them enough to eat just so theyll starve slower , executions are carried out at random . See how many people will want to return after a 1 year sentence . 1 year . If they commit another crime and return . Life . Cheap , inexpensive and fair . Show them mercy ? Did they show mercy ?
Where exactly did you find the eligibility for death penalty information ? I have searched for a little over a month and haven't been able to find it .
