Yes﻿
To people that are pro death penalty to me killing and murdering are practically the same thing, They both end in the same results a dead person. None are good and both are humane. If you kill the person that murdered you are no better than them﻿
*inhumane P
It's not a decision they are permitted to make. it is inhumane and cruel, and by just thinking that it is already to KILL does crimes you are sitting yourself up and making yourself worst that the crimes themself. tell me this what if the crime is innocent or would like to change in the near future?﻿
you did not give live so why take it.
ABOLISH THE DEATH PENALTY!﻿
You are nothing but a PO:hankey:.
So many fucking idiots in the comments section, anyone else see the fundamental flaw in the concept of killing someone to demonstrate that killing is bad? It's both barbaric and primitive to execute anyone, we're in the 21st century, not 10,000BC, there's other ways to punish and deter.﻿
Newsflash. Many people executed were never guilty in the first place.
yeah 4%, from what we know. you wouldn't want to be in that percentage and I'm sure you wouldn't want a friend or family member of yours to be in that one either. Abolish the barbaric death penalty. My arguments are based on facts, not opinion.
A lot of people are wrongful convicted﻿
if an innocent person is put to death and later on new evidence is found which proves they're innocent, they can't be released because they are dead
I don't think anyone sympathises with them, but sometimes innocent people are wrongly convicted
what if the poor guy is poorly represented. What if the officers/juries were corrupted. There are a long list of things that could happen and take away an innocent life. I would rather lock up thousands of murderers and save this poor man. There is no way to prevent innocents getting killed as long as there is death penalty.
Capital punishment is wrong, nothing more than planned ritualistic murder, nothing more than modern day human sacrifice. when a weapon is used to destroy someone, the weapon has to be destroyed, and that should include the state that causes another murder to happen. The worst capital punishment is the executions carried by governments in public that are so subtle and secret it looks like an accident.﻿
Innocent people get convicted for crimes they did not commit
Logic "let's murder someone because they murdered someone"﻿
What about people who are wrongfully convicted
The death penalty does not reduce crime rates. People who have committed heinous crimes often have people who love them, who haven't done anything wrong. Why should they lose their loved one? The death penalty is outdated and barbaric. I'm surprised it's still even legal in a first world country like America.﻿
The devil loves capital punishment and God hates it!!! Capital punishment is the work of the devil!!!﻿
No!!!!! the death penalty is not a way of justice, life in prison is the right choice!!! Killing another person just makes the other person just as bad and if everyone believed in capital punishment then the family of the death row in inmates would want death row for the people who are doing the excursion and then it goes on and on and that is not justice that is violent and that is what the devil wants not God﻿
“The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.” ― Anton Chekhov﻿
The law should always be stacked in favor of the innocent, including the wrongly accused. Sadly this means keeping some seriously fucked up parasites alive, because there is always a chance that a prisoner was indeed innocent, and this fact should trump all others. That is my take at least.﻿
No!Do you know why?Because it's considered murder ﻿
Death penalty is such an ignorant response to crime. It does not do to solve a problem by suggesting the problem itself as a solution. It is teaching the people that it is okay for the government to do such things, but not for the people, which completely diminishes the point of the morality 'do not commit sins/crimes.'﻿
Reasons why I'm against the death penalty: A) Innocent people are killed (5/100 on average in America) B) It's proven not to reduce crime in the area, so is not effective in preventing crime C) Wheres the line drawn between life sentence and execution (one brutal killing cutting a kid open vs 5 shootings which is worse) D) Ethnic minorities are more likely than whites to be executed for the same crime E) Wealthy are less likely to get executed than the poor (quality of lawyer should not determine life or death) F) 'Killing those who kill to teach them a lesson' is hypocritical in itself G) it's becomes a matter of revenge not justice H) is more expensive﻿
3:26 Is it a coincidence that those who support death penalty mostly look just like mass murderers themselves?﻿
Of course you are leaving out the facts that there are times the Victims Families supported a Life Sentence over the Death Penalty.
The Death Penalty is a Government over reach of power. The Countries in Latin America punish Murderers the best they make sure they get theirs but those Countries unlike the U.S knows that using the Death Penalty is an abuse of Government power. 
If an individual does not have the right to kill someone then how can we extend a right we don't have to the government? The only time it is okay to kill is in defense of ones own life. Also if we were to be attacked by another country, but we cease once they have fled our country. Not go over seas and pick fights.﻿
Why do we kill people to show people that killing is bad? Does not make any sense at all﻿
i think its should be the criminals rights to choose to either to kill himself or not. Not others﻿
What about reintegrating them into the communities again like Finland, Sweden and Norway which have the lowest return criminals in the world. If I spent 20 years in jail and came out with a bunch of new technology I'd most likely not get a job then turn back to robbing people for survival. Where is Baltic states you are brought up with new tech, they teach you traits etc.﻿
The only reason why I'm against the death penalty is that there has been innocent(meaning new technology shows that they did not do it) put to death.﻿
Why do americans defend their government having the right to execute them whenever they see it fit?﻿
But, most of the World doesn't have the Death Penalty.
Just look at the list which other countries also have death penalty...USA did a good job again being on a list with North Korea and Saudi Arabia. BTW, the evil evil Russia doesnt have capital punishment....But who cares about that, when you know whos the real evil, right?....﻿
There are innocent people on death row, that's why I am against it.﻿
