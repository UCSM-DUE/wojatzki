so my question to everyone here is if someone kills someone close to you would you want that person to still be alive? the answer is a a simple Yes or No﻿
Is there any way that I can get the script or sub of this video?﻿
*cough 4% *cough or we could go back to the days where all you have to do is say witch and their dead. My facts from Stanford University (Because I'm not a liberal basterd and find actual ligidament sourses) ----> http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230.abstract
It's not the execution cost, it's the trial of actually endicting the person of a crime worthy of capital punishment that is expensive.
I want to take this brief opportunity to piss off as many people as I can, from both sides, with this: The hardest thing about being a Christian is to obey the words of Christ: "Love thine enemy" and "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone".﻿
Idc your religion is a joke
So is the word "Johnson". Consult the movie 'The Big Lebowski'. 
I don't think that's the case in Singapore.

the last comment in this video posed an interesting concept: -the relationship between progressivism, capital punishment, and secularism. My question is to those who would say they are secular in the sense of believing Darwinist/evolutionary theory & who DO NOT believe in capital punishment. -As a secularist in this sense, why is capital punishment wrong if it is merely a playing out of "survival of the fittest"?﻿
Not slightly surprised at a comment like that written by an ebony person.
They make them beg for death? So they physically torture them or psychologically break them to the point of insanity?
Can someone tell me why in america they have death row? why do some people have to wait years on years to be killed? i thought one of the main arguements for the death penalty was that it cost signlifcantly less﻿
There shouldn't be a debate over the DP. You either believe in killing people, or you don't. Also, if you do believe in killing, and you support the DP, then you are ok with killing the innocent as well. Innocent are executed for the privilege of getting revenge on the guilty. This is inevitable and irrefutable.﻿
my friend hates this video everyone in the comments hate him !!!﻿

It seemed their was a higher portion of weirdos featured in this video then what society has.﻿
Biased much, Vice?﻿
In america the new and improved death penalty will be a cash cow for the private jails. Death penalty is for the lazy and greedy soon to be the greedy and lazy. We all know the decapitated human body can be kept alive with right equipment for an indefinite amount of time right?. You would need a stockpile of stackable, storage, watertight containers (fema coffins?) that could hold one body plus equipment. You know for the "freshness" factor in the organ harvesting (& other fluid an bits) by the aging elites. Well I would hope its for organs and not just a handy dandy snack in a pack for something else...﻿
