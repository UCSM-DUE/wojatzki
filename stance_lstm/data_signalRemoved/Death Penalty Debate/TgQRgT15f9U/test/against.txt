1_152	what how to go back 200 years in time ?
1_170	
1_173	Heck yeah . Here in Texas , we don't even care if they're guilty before we execute them . There's been at least five in the last 20 years that we're almost certain were innocent . Michael Morton was on death row 25 years before they finally figured out the Williamson County prosecutor was a lying sack of shit hell bent on racking up convictions and let him go . If they'd had that express-lane thing , they could have just buried the truth along with Mr. Morton and nobody would been the wiser . We don't really go for " wise " all that much in Texas . Makes people feel funny . ﻿
1_174	I'd be for the death penalty if Justice were not simply a human and therefore ' erred system . Because some motherfuckers need to die . ﻿
1_184	. not for the normal reasons though . Basicly , I think putting someone to death is too easy on them . one quick needle and its painlessly over . I say keep em alive where we can properly punish them . Maybe send them to a prison famous for big guys named Bubba or something . We don't know if there is a afterlife to punish them for sure , but we sure as hell know we can punish them here .
1_194	A civilized society doesn't kill the insane or retarded . To brag about it , go to Iran .
1_209	I do not see what is so glorious about killing people ? When mistakes are made , it can not be undone . Why aren't corrupt politicians executed for allowing innocent people to be put to death ? They murdered an innocent person .
1_215	For what it worth , It stupid and barbaric , as well as to expensive , believe it , or not .
1_216	That's dumb . BTW capital punishment to be more expensive .
1_218	not if you kill a incident person , which often happens .
1_219	let's see , so you don't care if capital punishment works , or not ? Or the fact that many incident people have been killed over the the years ? Your not thinking clearly at all .
1_220	You need to kill someone to show that killing a child is wrong ? If the United states is so smart , Why is your crime and murder rate so high . And Canada's is very low ? One more thing , why does the United States end up killing the wrong person so often ? Maybe Canada's not so dumb after all .
1_234	I too am tired of all these innocent people being murdered . Texas has killed countless people later proven to be innocent . I say we killed all the texans who not only indorse but pay for this to happen . I'm glad me and the Texans understand each other so well . Moronic hicks .
1_242	I can't speak for the others who are against the death penalty but the main reason is because innocent people have been condemned to death , and watch the documentary " The Last Word " in which the man who was put to death got screwed over by the District Attorney in texas and the medical examiner who withheld and tampered with crucial evidence that could've saved the man's life , just so they could get a conviction . Death Penalty isn't foolproof .
1_245	Lock him up for life , so he can get raped by Bubba and his other butt buddies . So , every time he sits down , he'll think about why he's in there . He will wish he was dead .
1_247	Alright , I can play that game too you small minded , tunnel visioned little pin head brained jerk . How's that ! Crawl out of your shell and start reading about the whole subject , jackass , and factor in EVERYTHING , moron , like law enforcement , prosecution costs and other unavoidable costs and necessary legal protections ( that protect YOU as well ) that I'm too exhausted by your stupidity to tell you . You're too obtuse to argue with any further so I'm done with you , you imbecile .
1_249	These FACTS sound illogical to you because you don't know the meaning of reasoned thinking . If you " can't even begin to describe how﻿ illogical " it sounds then you're incapable of reasoned thought because those statements are an expression of studied fact . They sound illogical to you because you cannot grasp their self evident meaning . You probably don't understand what you just read here either ... so why did I even bother ? The last question was rhetorical ! ( Look it up in a dictionary . )
