4_581	Make the death penalty quicker for them . The day after the case ends ... DEATH !!! ﻿
4_583	If one day , I have a choice between saving the life of a death row inmate or yours , I'll choose none . I would rather prevent the death of an innocent child .
4_586	brian shoemaker . who mentioned food ?? let them eat scraps from the bins . maybe theyll just wither away . problem solved .. ﻿
4_588	Woot ! My state might readd the death penalty again !
4_590	death is way too easy a punishment for these freaks . how do you suffer when your dead ? stick the pricks , aswell as all the kiddi fiddlers , in the main part of the jail population and let them sort them out . Allow them to be torchered everyday so they have a fair idea of the pain and torcher the families of their victims feel everyday . And unless any of you do-gooders have lost a relative or friend to something awful like that , please feel free to take these idiots into your home and see how well that works for you . ﻿
4_591	This society is in need to ensuring these bastards never kill again . ﻿
4_594	Some people are beyond redemption . ﻿
4_597	Thank you . The thing is we support the victims ' families , unlike anti-death penalty people , who support the victimizers and don't give a shit about the murderer's victims .
4_598	If someone I loved was raped and or killed , I would want this penalty for their killer . They would deserve nothing less . They did the fucking deed , and they NEED to pay for it . They made the willing to decision to take an innocent persons life . You anti-death penalty people , talk to the loved one of someone who has been murdered , and see how they feel . ﻿
4_599	.
4_602	An eye for an eye , a life for a life . Seems fair to me . ﻿
4_603	At least some one gets it
4_609	The answer is in 3:32 - 3:57 . No additional facts are necessary . If your loved one has been a victim , this will make sense to you .
4_613	Hey guys I am a liberal ! If you rape 390839038298398423 babies , kill 999999999 pregnant mothers , and gargle newborn dicks , you will only be put in jail for life :) Free food , shelter , occasional basketball games in the courtyard . YAAAAAAY ANTI DEATH PENALTY !!!!!........ ﻿
4_615	Well , they deserve it because of the things they did , so that's fair .
4_620	﻿
4_625	Very Well Done ! Hope you got an A+ ! As for the moron below me who says " Death to the Death Penalty " ... Well ... LOL ! I hope the rapists and mass murderers go to your house , or that you get the bill for housing , guarding , and feeding the baby killers of the world ... Numpty ... ﻿
4_627	Murder is the illegal taking of life . The death penalty is a justified , legal , systematic taking of life . Murderers and rapists surrender their right to live when they choose to commit such atrocities against society . ﻿
4_630	If you agree follow me on twitter @deathforcrimes ﻿
4_634	!!! ﻿
4_656	4th . Another lame comparison . You can't help where you live . You live where you can afford but if you go out and murder 10 people , I think everyone can agree that , that is something you have control over and that's the choice you made to break the law . Everyone can't be rehabilitated .
4_657	1st , comparing changing poverty to changing a sentence for people who have committed horrible crimes is lame . 2 . The death penalty is not what is expensive . It is the unlimited appeals process . There should be only one appeal and then that is it . Richard Ramirez was on death row so long he died of natural causes . That doesn't even make sense . 3rd . Yeah some humans are equal to dogs . You act like a wild animal you should be treated as such
4_659	Keeping those asshole's alive so they can kill an inmate that has a lesser sentance or worse a guard . Another person killed becuse this piece of shit did'nt get executed , another kid loses his father because dad was working a double shift at the prison , thats sounds pretty expensive to me . Plus I've seen the data , in the long run it's cheaper to execute them . Personally I think we are to humane about it . Execution's should be public and gruesome , then people will think twice b4 comiting murder !
4_660	First off your most likely a privileged person who has never seen a real hanus crime take place ! If you do your tune will change quick , trust me . Second by your little peace sign Im guessing you work at Starbuck's , you're a liberal , and you don't understand how much it cost's to keep some of these piece's of shit alive . It's just another cause for you to rally behind . Michigan was the first state to get rid of the death penalty and guess what , they want it back now . I wonder why ?
4_662	They are not being '' murdered '' . Everyone knows their is a death penalty and when you go out and rape and kill children and receive it . . . well I consider that more a form of suicide than '' murder '' . It costs 35K - 40K to keep a death row inmate locked up . Why keep them alive ? We put dogs down for running wild . The same needs to be done for people The death penalty has been around since the beginning of time . No point in changing it now
4_664	Know what's weird ? I know democrats who believe in abortion but not the death penalty and Republicans who believe in the death penalty but not abortion . I believe in both and I think we should keep both .
4_665	Oh , and let me add , I'm not a democrat or republican . I'm an independent . * The death penalty always comes back to party lines that's why I added that
4_666	It's not outdated . Millions of people still believe in the death penalty . I stay in California and , while the numbers were tight , most people voted to keep it . . I know many young people who do
4_670	Murdering and killing are not the same thing . Murder is an unlawful and premeditated killing of a human being by another . A kill , is the act of ending the life of someone . Would you consider a cop killing a criminal that's threatening your life a murderer ? Would you feel safe , living under a government that is not allowed to take someone who's trying to kill you down ? I don't think so .
4_672	'' Murdering '' murderers . Breaks my heart . . . Those poor , poor murderers . It's right up there with the Genocide in Rwanda and 9/11 on the things that make me sad . Tragic
4_681	. People care more about the criminals than they do about the victims . Getting rid of the death penalty is step one . Before you know it , people are going to be against violent criminals getting life in prison cause it's '' inhumane '' .
4_683	. Some Crimes are so Heinous , so Horrible ; That the only responce that We as a CIVILIZED nation have is to " BRING THE MOTHERF ... R DOWN " . makes sense .
4_684	To my opinion ,
4_689	Make special prisons for the most heinous of offenders . Not unlike Auchwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka . We have too many people making a life out of getting in jail , too many people loving a thug lifestyle and golifying crime . Give them enough to eat just so theyll starve slower , executions are carried out at random . See how many people will want to return after a 1 year sentence . 1 year . If they commit another crime and return . Life . Cheap , inexpensive and fair . Show them mercy ? Did they show mercy ?
4_692	If you are a sociopath , you feel NO pain . Get real .
4_693	Again , thank you for your common sense . Not all people are worthy of life .
4_695	Thank you Chance for speaking your mind with common sense . I do not want these animals living next door to me or anyone else for that matter .
4_698	If there is no doubt that the person deserves the death penalty then allow them to be murdered but don't do these pussy excutions that cost way to much money . Take them out back and shoot them in the head . Right after they get the death penalty . It is suppose to be used to detour people from doing these crimes if you are going to keep someone on death row for 20 plus years then it does no good . I don't understand are death penalty as it is now . It is a form of revenge not justice . But that may
