5_702	To people that are pro death penalty to me killing and murdering are practically the same thing , They both end in the same results a dead person . None are good and both are humane . If you kill the person that murdered you are no better than them﻿
5_706	It's not a decision they are permitted to make . it is inhumane and cruel , and by just thinking that it is already to KILL does crimes you are sitting yourself up and making yourself worst that the crimes themself . tell me this what if the crime is innocent or would like to change in the near future ? ﻿
5_707	you did not give live so why take it .
5_710	! ﻿
5_712	You are nothing but a PO : hankey : .
5_716	So many fucking idiots in the comments section , anyone else see the fundamental flaw in the concept of killing someone to demonstrate that killing is bad ? It's both barbaric and primitive to execute anyone , we're in the 21st century , not 10,000 BC , there's other ways to punish and deter . ﻿
5_721	Newsflash . Many people executed were never guilty in the first place .
5_723	yeah 4% , from what we know . you wouldn't want to be in that percentage and I'm sure you wouldn't want a friend or family member of yours to be in that one either . . My arguments are based on facts , not opinion .
5_725	A lot of people are wrongful convicted﻿
5_727	if an innocent person is put to death and later on new evidence is found which proves they're innocent , they can't be released because they are dead
5_737	I don't think anyone sympathises with them , but sometimes innocent people are wrongly convicted
5_741	what if the poor guy is poorly represented . What if the officers/juries were corrupted . There are a long list of things that could happen and take away an innocent life . I would rather lock up thousands of murderers and save this poor man . There is no way to prevent innocents getting killed as long as there is death penalty .
5_744	, nothing more than planned ritualistic murder , nothing more than modern day human sacrifice . when a weapon is used to destroy someone , the weapon has to be destroyed , and that should include the state that causes another murder to happen . The worst capital punishment is the executions carried by governments in public that are so subtle and secret it looks like an accident . ﻿
5_746	Innocent people get convicted for crimes they did not commit
5_748	Logic " let's murder someone because they murdered someone " ﻿
5_750	What about people who are wrongfully convicted
5_762	The death penalty does not reduce crime rates . People who have committed heinous crimes often have people who love them , who haven't done anything wrong . Why should they lose their loved one ? The death penalty is outdated and barbaric . I'm surprised it's still even legal in a first world country like America . ﻿
5_763	﻿
5_764	No !!!!! , life in prison is the right choice !!! Killing another person just makes the other person just as bad and if everyone believed in capital punishment then the family of the death row in inmates would want death row for the people who are doing the excursion and then it goes on and on and that is not justice that is violent and that is what the devil wants not God﻿
5_768	“ The State is not God . It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to . ” ― Anton Chekhov﻿
5_775	The law should always be stacked in favor of the innocent , including the wrongly accused . Sadly this means keeping some seriously fucked up parasites alive , because there is always a chance that a prisoner was indeed innocent , and this fact should trump all others . That is my take at least . ﻿
5_776	Can someone tell me why in america they have death row ? why do some people have to wait years on years to be killed ? i thought one of the main arguements for the death penalty was that it cost signlifcantly less﻿
5_778	No ! Do you know why ? Because it's considered murder ﻿
5_781	Death penalty is such an ignorant response to crime . It does not do to solve a problem by suggesting the problem itself as a solution . It is teaching the people that it is okay for the government to do such things , but not for the people , which completely diminishes the point of the morality ' do not commit sins/crimes . ' ﻿
5_783	Reasons why : A ) Innocent people are killed ( 5/100 on average in America ) B ) It's proven not to reduce crime in the area , so is not effective in preventing crime C ) Wheres the line drawn between life sentence and execution ( one brutal killing cutting a kid open vs 5 shootings which is worse ) D ) Ethnic minorities are more likely than whites to be executed for the same crime E ) Wealthy are less likely to get executed than the poor ( quality of lawyer should not determine life or death ) F ) ' Killing those who kill to teach them a lesson ' is hypocritical in itself G ) it's becomes a matter of revenge not justice H ) is more expensive﻿
5_786	3:26 Is it a coincidence that those who support death penalty mostly look just like mass murderers themselves ? ﻿
5_788	Of course you are leaving out the facts that there are times the Victims Families supported a Life Sentence over the Death Penalty .
5_790	The Death Penalty is a Government over reach of power . The Countries in Latin America punish Murderers the best they make sure they get theirs but those Countries unlike the U.S knows that using the Death Penalty is an abuse of Government power .
5_792	If an individual does not have the right to kill someone then how can we extend a right we don't have to the government ? The only time it is okay to kill is in defense of ones own life . Also if we were to be attacked by another country , but we cease once they have fled our country . Not go over seas and pick fights . ﻿
5_793	Why do we kill people to show people that killing is bad ? Does not make any sense at all﻿
5_794	i think its should be the criminals rights to choose to either to kill himself or not . Not others﻿
5_796	What about reintegrating them into the communities again like Finland , Sweden and Norway which have the lowest return criminals in the world . If I spent 20 years in jail and came out with a bunch of new technology I'd most likely not get a job then turn back to robbing people for survival . Where is Baltic states you are brought up with new tech , they teach you traits etc . ﻿
5_800	The only reason why is that there has been innocent(meaning new technology shows that they did not do it ) put to death . ﻿
5_802	Why do americans defend their government having the right to execute them whenever they see it fit ? ﻿
5_808	But , most of the World doesn't have the Death Penalty .
5_813	Just look at the list which other countries also have death penalty ... USA did a good job again being on a list with North Korea and Saudi Arabia . BTW , the evil evil Russia doesnt have capital punishment .... But who cares about that , when you know whos the real evil , right ?.... ﻿
5_814	There are innocent people on death row , that's why . ﻿
5_817	I'm from Houston so you know my take on this but just like the Boston bomber I think he should root in jail ... The death penalty is an easy out although the waiting for it being on dead row much be brutal﻿
5_818	I don't favor the death penalty , but there are some people who do need to be escorted off this planet ASAP ! Like those two murderers who victimized the Petit Family in Connecticut . I hope those a**wipes are quickly eliminated . ﻿
