4_585	ok﻿
4_589	There are FAR worse things you can do to someone than kill them . Ian Brady convicted serial child killer in the UK has been serving a whole life tariff since 1966 . He has come to the realisation that he is better off dead so he is on hunger strike . He is currently being force fed . I hope he lives to 100 - 23 years to go ! ﻿
4_595	The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . ﻿
4_600	zzzzzzz
4_610	dont attack them they made it for a debate class and the video does not reflect their personal views
4_611	well thats the point isnt it ? they're not going to show them doing good shit are they ? its because they committed a crime ..... and what should the victims look like ? hardcore cunts ? sounds silly really doesnt it ?
4_612	ok
4_614	condemned *
4_618	If anyone knows the name of the song please let me know ? c : ﻿
4_619	Karma Police -Radio Head
4_622	anti death penalty person who wishes death for pro death penalty person .. how ridiculous
4_624	nice this helped me in school :D ﻿
4_626	I think John Floyd Thomas Jr. was sentenced to life in prison without parol not the death penalty . i am not sure tho ! ﻿
4_628	As disgusting as it is , should all rape be considered in the same terms as the taking of life ? I doubt it .
4_632	For all you people out there not aware of the political situation in other countries . Several Southeast Asian countries have the death penalty for non-murder related charges such as drug trafficking . And people think U.S.A is harsh . SMH﻿
4_633	But , yet the U.S has the 5th Highest Execution Rate , in the World . Nobody said the U.S was the most Inhumane Country . But you're leaving out the fact that many other Countries do have a better Human Rights Record than America does : The Falklands , Argentina , Canada , Greenland , Australia , New Zealand , & almost every single Country in Europe , undoubtedly has a better Human Rights Record than America does .
4_635	Liked the video and the song by Radio Head was perfect . ﻿
4_638	America ain't civilized in your opinion
4_642	Personal attacks instead of a counter argument ? Excellent tactic ! :p
4_645	None of those countries have it either .
4_646	You should be happy with how Ramirez died seeing as you like gruesome painful executions . Cancer is far crueler than any execution method on the books .
4_650	As far as I'm aware , Eric Casseus was not sentenced to death - he actually faced 5-15 years in prison . He maintained his innocence as well .
4_658	Other countries also don't have the same violent crime we have here in America and your right Give it some years and it might happen
4_669	Death Penalty = Easy way out . Simple .
4_671	The government already does murder people you dumb twat have you ever heard of the military ?
4_678	Jerry's mug shot on this clip was from his time in Memphis when he was drunk and armed outside Graceland , yelling for Elvis to come outside .
4_679	Where did WALLFLOWERxiii get their information on Jerry Lee Lewis getting the death penalty for drug trafficking ? In 2012 he married his cousin's ex-wife and is living in Mississippi , not on death row . I can find very little to no information on his life of crime but what I have found is very disturbing , ie : killing grand jury witnesses , deputy sheriffs , police informants , etc . Why is this old " Killer " still free ?
4_682	Was wondering what's the song " s name :)
4_685	the best part of this video was the song . <3 Radiohead
4_686	To those monsters , I say good riddance .
4_687	Yes , good , appeal to emotion , that'll prove your moral argument .
4_688	ok guy at 1:43 lol wtf is that about ? did he use the child as a shield , and the police shot the child ? or did they murder him just for using the child as a shield , and no one was hurt ? that would be pretty stupid if the police accidentally shot the child trying to shoot the robber . and all for what ... money ? money that the police officer has no involvement in ? money that would've been easily replaced by the bank rofl . good judgment call bro , thats why u make the big bucks .
4_690	Fine , moron , then you can pay for it .
4_691	They can get more drugs than on the street , probably .
4_694	Thank You !!
4_696	Where exactly did you find the eligibility for death penalty information ? I have searched for a little over a month and haven't been able to find it .
4_697	just be me .
