4_582	if one day , I have a choice between saving the life of a death row inmate or yours , I'll choose the first one . There's any hope left for him or her on becoming a useful person .
4_587	I feel sorry for people supporting death penalty . In the best case , their lifes are filled with hate and bitterness . In the worst case , their souls are dead too . ﻿
4_592	I don't believe in the death penalty actually Not because of all that liberal bull shit But because its to humane If my mother was murdered by some psycho Ide torture the shit out of them if i had the chance And then ide kill them ﻿
4_593	We will kill the innocent peopled so the murderers can't good advice﻿
4_596	The death penalty for those who support it . ﻿
4_601	Life in prison without possibility of parole , is worse punishment than death for those that don't believe in anything beyond this life . But the fact that there've been many innocent people exonerated that are on death row destroys the entire justification for the death penalty . If just ONE innocent person is put to death the entire system is morally reprehensible . The FBI just he classified how their hair analysis was flawed in many convictions we're based on erroneous data . Anyone who you would think be eligible for the death penalty give them life without the possibility of parole(unless further evidence exonerates them ) and you have done the the victims family Justice .

4_605	ahah a pro-Death penalty video posted by " All you need is love . " ... Am I the only one to see the irony ? ﻿
4_606	if OBONGO supports it then it must be something fishy about it ! No death penalty ! ﻿
4_607	This video disgusts me , you're trying to manipulate people into thinking that the death penalty is good by showing these violent criminals and innocent victims . You can't show some actual facts about why the death penalty is good , instead you have to put up some music in the background and show criminals and victims hoping your viewers will sniffle up . Give me a break . ﻿
4_608	Look , I'm not criticizing the penalty ( though I don't agree with it ) , I'm criticizing the video . She presents no arguments whatsoever , no statistics , or solid proof that the death penalty is a good thing . Again , I wasn't criticizing what she thinks , I was criticizing the video .
4_616	hi i'm retarded ( or just conservative ) and i hate the government and think they can't do anything right ... except kill people
4_617	So you think putting them out of their Missuri is going to be worse than being stuck in a cage for the rest of your lifetime with horrible food btw
4_621	Then you should die today .
4_623	I see US still live in the dark age and I hope the death penalty will be abolished . ﻿
4_629	Death to the death penalty . ﻿
4_631	People say that murder is wrong but isnt death penalty murder and
4_636	!!! And I am not religios , but this should mean something .. don't you think ... BAN THE DEATH PENALTY !!!
4_637	Seeing the pictures of the victims hurts me .... but we have no right at all to take the life of somebody even if he done such horrible things ! Because the death penalty is inhuman and yes all those murderer and rapists are human and should be treat like that otherwise we wouldn't be better than tthem and thi is what makes a democracy !! BAN THE DEATH PENALTY !!!!!!!!!
4_639	What gives you the impression that I'm against providing Saddam a lawyer ? I was just commenting on his audacity and inability to sympathize with anyone else . I completely and 100% agree with you , which also happens to be one of the biggest reasons I'm opposed to the death penalty . .
4_640	In self defence I have no problem with it . When the person is unarmed , in custody and no longer a threat then I would and do have a problem with it .
4_641	Yeah , generally people who are armed and shooting at them . I see no problem with killing in that situation . When the person is unarmed and no longer a threat - then no .
4_643	.
4_644	Millions of people believe in honour killings and genital mutilation . That doesnt make it right .
4_647	No they wouldnt . People are executed i public regularly in Saudi Arabia and Iran . It has no effect .
4_648	Id rather have 1000 serial killers alive on death row than to execute one innocent person along with them . Until there is an infallible system there is no way I can support execution as it is irreversible . If they are found not guilty while in prison they can still be freed and have a chance at putting things back together . If they're dead - they cant and their families get nothing for the mistake .
4_649	As you know there were no lawyers for his victims . Thats a big part of why he was charged and tried . If we ( general we ) were to prevent him from having defence counsel and gave him a show trial and speedy execution we would be no better than him . Instead he was given a lot better than what he gave - and thats the way it should be . Doesnt work that way .
4_651	I'm against the death penalty , but you know what ? When Saddam Hussein was in court demanding his lawyer , the only thing I could even say was " where were the lawyers of the 250,000 Kurds you mercilessly slaughtered , or the 150,000 Shiites ? What legal safeguards did you provide the Iranians and Kuwaitis as you rampaged through their countryside unprovoked , pillaging and murdering along the way ? " I say this as someone who opposes the Iraq War , both from the outset and in retrospect .
4_652	And Sudan . Sudan also has the death penalty . Yeah , not a list you'd like to be associated with .
4_653	. You ever heard of the Troy Davies case btw ? Or even the case from Iran of a boy executed for manslaughter for a crime he committed when he was just 16 .
4_654	4 . Again , looking at the argument objectively instead of actually reading into what I am saying between the lines . If you put yourself in a situation where you might be killed , it is stupid , but it is not your fault if you die , it is not suicide , and furthermore it does not justify someone murdering you . If you could come up with a new argument with some substance that could morally justifying killing people that would be great .
4_655	1 . It's not an objective comparison , its showing up how shit your " It's always been that way so let's not change it " argument it . By your logic we should still be in the Stone age 2 . Come back to me when you can get a constitutional amendment that will ensure more innocents get executed and continue a practice most 1st world countries have abolished . 3 . ?
4_661	1 . Ok , so me living in a dangerous neighborhood with a high homicide rate is also suicide because I might get killed by a vagrant . No , the vagrant is still a murder . Similarly there is always a chance that the criminal won't be executed for one reason or another 2 . Are you saying that humans are equal to dogs ? 3 . It costs more to execute than to lock them up as the procedure for execution is long and expensive . 4 . Poverty has been around since the beginning of time . No point in changing it ?
4_663	Death penalty isn't an effective deterrent , look at the research and the numbers , and . Nuff said
4_667	I'm against the death penalty because an innocent person might be killed .
4_668	If a person poses an immediate threat and the only way to stop them was by killing them then I'd say that is justified and not murder . If the person is killed after they are no longer a threat then I would call it murder .
4_673	Civilized ? Have you seen the list of countries that have the death penalty compared to those that dont ? Iran , North Korea , Saudi Arabia , China , Pakistan , Vietnam , Congo and Cuba all have it . Those without , Canada , the entire European Union , Australia , New Zealand , Switzerland . I'll stick to the second list . Those countries also have a far lower murder rate than those with the death penalty . Its barbaric and useless .
4_674	Bullshit . I felt reasonably cared for when they locked up the guy . It didnt change my opinion on capital punishment at all . If they ever brought it back here Id strongly consider leaving . I refuse to live under and support a government that murders people .
4_675	Doubt it . They executed way more people when they were still doing that compared to today .
4_676	About 140 people were exonerated while on death row . If you killed them right away instead of allowing the appeals to take place the state would have the blood of 140 innocent people on their hands . Thats almost as many as Timothy McViegh killed .
4_677	Id rather have 1000 guilty serial killers alive in jail than to risk executing one innocent person along with them . We need a perfect justice system to prevent that . It doesnt exist right now and I dont imagine it ever will . If you compare the murder rates in places without the death penalty to those with it you will notice it had absolutely no deterrent effect . Oddly places with the death penalty have a higher murder rate generally .
4_680	Actually the death penalty costs more , way more . And states that don't have the death penalty consistently have lower murder rates than those that do . Not only is life without parole more of a deterrent , it's reversible if someone is later proven to be innocent .
