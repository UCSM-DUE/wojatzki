1_138	LMAO﻿
1_139	when you record off the tv make sure to check the volume and hold the camera still﻿
1_140	Instead of shooting them in the leg , tap their shoulder and say " excuse me " . ﻿
1_141	I fucking hate California ... ﻿
1_142	I moved to Calif ( Oceanside ) . My husband was in the Marines . Instead of my name , " Elaine " ... they always called me " Texie . " I felt awkward the entire time I was there ..... I just didn't fit in too well . I was so glad to get back to Ft . Worth , TX
1_145	Most boring state in the U.S. Hell I'd rather live in Alaska
1_146	i think people who feel the need to record something off of a tv screen and post it on youtube require the death penalty .... ﻿
1_147	read what rebel born wrote ... ﻿
1_149	And somehow is the most powerful country in the world . It's okay to be jealous . ' Merica
1_150	" I motioned the bartender to meet me in the Liquor Room . " - From that sentence on I expected gay porn to break out .
1_153	More like having individual freedoms , no state income tax , affordable living , and most importantly , a governor who is not a complete libtard idiot buffoon . I would move to TX in a heartbeat if I could . CA is a nightmare . I know people who live there who want out desperately .
1_154	Texas beats the shit out of Cali . And I have family in Cali .
1_155	It is just the complex phenomenon of the mind or involuntary reaction of notions . ﻿
1_156	If people are that sane why have a death penalty and a prison too . It is just there in the society and hard to know why . ﻿
1_157	"' Who's shooting me in the leg ? '" I wonder quietly to myself . " Oh , that guy . " POW ! Never turn around . ﻿
1_158	Don't place the blame , son . It's easy that way , but it ain't honest . ﻿
1_160	does anyone know if aggressive death penalty laws prevent murder or is it difficult to say since Texas probably always had the death penalty ? ﻿
1_167	y not go and get rid of everyone and start from scratch
1_168	I hope you're being facetious . Otherwise that statement is just too fucking stupid to comment on . I'll leave it to you to figure out why . If you can .
1_169	they have been on a roll the last few years !! ﻿
1_171	They always execute people before an election .
1_176	So logically , if a murderer is afraid to die , then why would he replicate that fear on those he harms ? Only at the point where you forfeit your life completely do you realize that other lives are forfeit as well . That's the tried-and-true pathology of any common murderer and I'm talking about the premeditated kind and not the passionate . If you don't think I have common sense , then you know nothing about our crime and punishment system and probably should be recused from participating in civic duty in that regard , due to " incompetence " .
1_178	In Utah you can still bee killed by firing squad﻿
1_179	Why be so quick ? Seems the POS needs a little personal treatment , maybe two to three weeks worth .
1_181	Mark , bet you would not say that to duck's face ! Coward . Or , maybe even to mine , and I'm an old Tea Party person who once was a Democrat , till they started killing babies legally .
1_182	Damn ! He's good ! " I wonder quietly to myself . "
1_183	abortion doctors give a great service by keeping the human population under control .
1_186	Only in texASS !
1_196	Liberals are absolutely KILLING our country . Do I believe we should aid those we can't do it for themselves ? Yes , but there are too many holes in system so that homegirl gets to use hers lone star card while sending a txt on her iPhone .
1_197	Liberal this liberal that . You dittoheads all sound the same . I love Ron White , but I don't think this bit was intended as some kind of fanatical right wing mandate . Wow , you people are morons .
1_200	hope you can reach that goal . I understand .
1_204	whatever you jack ass
1_205	Are you sure they're innocent because most of them aren't .
1_211	So freakin ' good , I've got tears :D
1_212	what in texas hey hang people ?
1_213	My condolences . I can not a imagine how awful you must . feel . We may not agree on a lot of things , but this is at least a billion times bigger then politics .
1_217	Dear not funny comedian : California also has capital punishment . Find a dictionary and look up the the word research .
1_224	Well bless your heart .
1_227	yep , that too is also true , we Texans love our guns .
1_228	I would bet that in Texas , the bad guy might of only got off a couple of shots before the redneck theatre-goers returned fire . God help the Aurora injured , Rest in Peace the Aurora dead . God Bless Texas .
1_237	People would have more confidence in death penaly convictions if prosecutors , judges or police officers were EVER charged for misconduct .
1_240	He's a comedy genius ... But , as for the comments . Just FYI ... If someone is against the death penalty , that doesn't mean that that person loves criminals or is a pussy or is a disease . Not saying that there isn't a debate to be had ... Just don't single people out as pussies .
1_243	wins ! DING DING ! KO
1_244	im glad im TEXAN
