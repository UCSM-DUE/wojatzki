3_400	someone who thinks that they will not be caught ? ﻿
3_401	Your position is invalid . USA executes loads of criminals yet it's homicide rate is one of the highest of all developed nations . ﻿
3_407	If someone is found to be innocent then they can be released and compensated . Capital punishment is final , you can't give an innocent their life back once you've fucking killed them .
3_415	Yeah again your entire argument is just revenge which has no economic or social benefits other than to make the family of the dead . " Less angry " . Oh lol I still love how you made up that 88% statistic lol . Because in truth or scientific data goes against you . You just cannot accept it ..
3_423	Society is just a group of people who are required to abide by a set of rules . Those who don't wish to abide by these rules and break them are simply just removed from this society and taken to a place called jail . I don't understand what more their is to discuss or why you need to make it anymore complicated . Those who support the death penalty state that it acts as a deterrent ! Well , if you want a deterrent then why not just use torture as the punishment for the crime . ﻿
3_424	I am against the death penalty . Is a legalized murder . It's revenge of the State . This law is immoral . ﻿
3_426	The Burden of Proof Priti Patel is referring to in this video is Beyond the shadow of a doubt is the strictest standard of proof . It requires that there be no doubt as to the issue . Widely considered an impossible standard , a situation stemming from the nature of knowledge itself , it is valuable to mention only as a comment on the fact that evidence in a court never need ( nor can ) reach this level . This phrase , has , nonetheless , come to be associated with the law in popular culture . ﻿
3_427	Anybody who supports this is either a moron or very ignorant . ﻿
3_437	I'm not dismissing the Old Testament . Like I've said before ' Thou shall not kill ' . Why is it that this particular Commandment can be bent but one such as ' Thou shall not commit adultery ' can't ? Pardon me , but I think it more immoral for someone to kill someone ( whether it be the state or not ) than if they gossiped a little bit ( Thou shall not bear false witness ) but seeing as so many Christians tend to bend the Bible to their own liking and to fit their agenda ( Westboro Baptist Church for example ) it's little wonder that in certain places , say certain American states , you can still be jailed for " Sodomy " but you're okay to get the lethal injection .
3_442	Conservatives should be made to watch " Making a murderer " on netflix . ABSOLUTE PROOF will never exist
3_443	True , or just watch Minority Report , even Tom Cruise knows , that's how obvious it is .
3_448	Priti Patel is thick . .
3_450	Murdering in order to show intolarance of murder ... hmmmm . ﻿
3_460	The conservatives make me sick . ' They choose to commit the crimes ' . What about mental illnesses ? Oh wait , sorry I forgot that the conservative don't care about mental health . All they care about is money , they don't give a shit about what the British people want . I can't help but ask myself : WTF is wrong with people ? Why would you vote for these money grabbing honkeys ? ﻿
3_464	So much ignorance about mental illness during this debate . ' It makes them think twice . ' Really ? How about you think twice why these people do these things in the first place . It's not on a whim just because you want to do something horrible to another person . What about if they're high on drugs or mentally ill . . ﻿
3_469	I'm against the death penalty for many reasons . First , it doesn't get to the root of them problem and fix the causes that compel them to a crime . Second , . Third , it's possible for people to be killed who have never committed the crime . But most importantly , it sends the wrong message . It says " It's not okay for you as a citizen to kill someone , but it's okay for the government to kill you . " ﻿
3_472	Priti Patel is a plonker . ﻿
3_477	Death penalty is a thing of the dark ages . ﻿
3_481	Priti Patel MP would change her tune if it was someone she knew/loved who was sentenced to death . , it is an hipocrisy . Families of murder victims have been found to be disatisfied after the execution of the perpetrator - no matter how much they wanted it - because there is nowhere left to direct their anger . ﻿
3_485	Considering that untouchable politicians have skeletons in their closests as well as the endless controversy surrounding westminster , I for one don't feel confortable or 100% confident with who they choose who gets to live and who gets to die . ﻿
3_487	Rather ironically the only person i would approve for capital punishment is priti patel . ﻿
3_490	It worries me that we elect people like Priti Patel . . She needs to familiarise herself with facts . There is a massive amount of evidence to suggest that it does not have any deterrent effect . ﻿
3_492	I see common sense isn't your strongest suit . So by your logic , . Looking at it in another way , by your logic ( and please give evidence ) would you say that seeing as Texas puts the most people to death , are you saying therefore that it has the lowest murder rates in the U.S. ?
3_495	The state murdering it's own citizens is a long slippery and dangerous road to go down . ﻿
3_496	In my country of Canada , the last executions were over 50 years ago . Capital punishment is barbaric . ﻿
3_502	1 ) 2 ) it costs more 3 ) It doesn't help clear prisons , because the long legal battle after the sentence keeps prisoners on death row for a long time 4 ) it is always possible to KILL AN INNOCENT PERSON under this justice system How anybody can support it is completely beyond me ! To think this woman has a position in the cabinet now is terrifying ! ﻿
3_511	Bloody hell . This woman's a monster . ﻿
3_513	But that's his point isn't it , that she is as monstrous as the murderers themselves as she's really , advocating a different type of murder .
3_517	It's scary that she's the DWP minister now . . Could turn a crime of passion , for instance , into several more crimes of desperation . Thoughtless input from the wicked tory battleaxe . ﻿
3_520	I don't understand the death penalty , surely it is the easy way out for criminals because if they are dead then they won't be around to suffer for their crimes and receive a punishment . . ﻿
3_524	If you support the death penalty you also ( intentionally or not ) support the execution of innocent people . Justify that . What if you find yourself on death row for a crime you didn't commit are you going to say " Oh well , at least they're right most of the time , I'm a worthy sacrifice " ﻿
3_530	The utter stupidity and willful ignorance of Priti and other death penalty advocates is just staggering . They throw out nonsense that has no scientific basis , , nor has any common sense basis since the most heinous crimes where you would apply it to are done out of sheer irrational rage or mental instability or by socio/psyhcopaths . Anybody who thinks somebody rapes and murders a child or slices a human being in pieces to eat it is rational and if only he wouldn't risk prison but the death penalty , then he wouldn't do it , probably needs some psychological evaluation themselves .. ﻿
3_531	state sponsored murder is still murder , you might think you can justify it , but you can not , no justice system is 100 accurate , miscarriages will happen , you are the monster you deny . the death penalty is an act of a tyrant . a true Justice system should be about justice never revenge .
3_534	DNA isn't 100% accurate and can get contaminated .
3_535	There is no need for the death penalty in England . You only have what ? 800 murders a year ? Just lock them up for life so that they cant kill again . That way , if there has been a miscarriage of justice at least no innocent person has died . In any case , we need murders , natural disasters , suicides , wars , diseases etc otherwise the world would be overpopulated by now . ﻿
3_537	Multiple studies have shown this .
3_541	Fact is the death penalty costs more ( so you can use ' oh we tax payers have to pay to keep them in prison ) because of the longer process of ensuring its the right decision . , do you think the average person is likely to rape , beat or murder someone ? Those are people who do it in the heat of the moment ( anger ) , under the influence of drugs/alcohol or suffer from mental illnesses . ﻿
3_543	Priti Patel view is ; -'shot first , ask questions when the flies start taking interest ' As for crime , we have a deterrent , its called the Prison , and that rarely works . The justice system is run by humans , judges are human , lawyers are often sub-human , and the justice system gets it wrong , sometimes terribly , and the guilty walk . We only need to look at our political and corporate elite to see that . ﻿
3_546	It is obvious that no moral argument is going to sway the hangers , floggers , and bashers , so perhaps change of tack is needed ? I propose , that the names and addresses of Death Penalty supporters be kept in a register , and should it be reinstated , every time an innocent person gets the chop , a dozen or so randomly selected people on this list should be forced to meet the victim's family face-to-face , negotiate a price for the victim's life , and compensate them with the agreed amount out of their own pockets . What's the betting that as soon as money is involved , all of a sudden they will acquire some principles , and life imprisonment will be the preferred option ? ﻿
3_547	Why do people murder ? For profit- so they know the risks involved . In passion- done without aforethought . Or by compulsion- so it cannot be controlled . . ﻿
3_549	I think life in solitary is actually worse . Whether you believe in an afterlife or not , years of boredom first is a good punishment .
3_551	Calm down , it's only an idea . I don't believe in the death penalty anyway so that's the alternative .
3_557	piri patel , what a disgusting person , hope when someone she loves faces a death penalty say in Pakistan she changes her tune , ﻿
3_564	Pitel's fear mongering is the same type of platitudes voiced by the American conservatives who favor capital punishment . As an American I wish we would abolish a nonsensical law based not on jurisprudence but on a primordial sense of vengeance . ﻿
3_569	And if one of your children was convicted and put on death row ....
3_571	Obviously , Patel wants the death penalty back , as a lobbyist for tobacco companies , she likes dealing out death . ﻿
3_572	The only people in favour of the death penalty are these hardballing , yuppie types who think they're too clever by half . A little knowledge is a dangerous thing .. how can you show someone , who dismisses anything they don't agree with , the error of their ways ? Ignorance is bliss . ﻿
3_576	" if you kill a shithead you should get the world's applause . " If you believe that then why don't you put it into practice and kill yourself ?
3_578	Very well put , and I'd like to add my pov : 1 ) Every kill/murder should obviously never be met with equal terms ; gangster killing gangster vs . anyone killling child etc 2 ) Adding to above , even if you get thrown in Death Row there should be about 1 hour beating with real physical harm before the fact . 3 ) My final option is : no death penalty for anyone , but that beating I mentioned already and then absolute incarcerated sentence ( to every criminal ) WITH possibility of suicide any given time ( ever-present cyanide capsule or sotn )
