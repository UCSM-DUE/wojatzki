0_1	The death penalty should apply only in cases where the evidence could not be disputed in any way . I do not want to waste our tax dollars on keeping a guy like James Homes , Vincent Lee , or the Boston bomber brother alive in prison . We decide not to rehabilitate a dog who rips a mans throat out , we just put them down . Tell me why we shouldn't do the same to humans . ﻿
0_3	but what's the alternative ? . ﻿
0_7	but what's the alternative ? . ﻿
0_8	but what's the alternative ? . ﻿
0_10	what if there is video evidence ? and you're 100% certain , can we kill child mass murderers then ? ﻿
0_11	I oppose a State death penalty , but support a market death penalty in cases where guilt is absolutely certain . ﻿
0_14	30 years of torture(prison ) vs death ????? Please kill me . I'll be killing and/or harming your guards either(if I did the crime or not ) way . ﻿
0_15	Your premise is in error . NOT having the death penalty is part of why we allow slipshod courts in the first place . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqCIvLN1ess﻿
0_21	He has a fair point but overpopulation is also a serious epidemic and the death penalty helps with that a lot . ﻿
0_23	My dad just always says that instead of wasting all the money on these crazy people , just put them all on an island and let them kill each other off . Wouldn't waste money and it would be their choice on wether to live or defend themselves . I have never felt like the death penalty was a bad thing , ever . Yes I'm sure some people are innocent , but I just think of the people who are not . I don't think About how it doesn't decline murder rates or crap like that , I while we could spend it on so much more worthy things . ﻿
0_26	Then lets just not imprison anyone dont want to risk sending an innocent to jail lets just let all the accused murders and rapist and drug dealers out we can prove it 100%﻿
0_28	This guy thinks Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the Boston Bomber should live , he thinks john wayne Gacy should still be alive﻿
0_29	The Death Penatly sometimes needs to be there if someone is just too dangerous . ﻿
0_33	Has anybody heard of an eye for an eye﻿
0_37	I tend to be pro-death penalty ( for both murder and rape ) , but for once I'm seeing a coherent argument against my position . Usually the arguments are about racial bias in the police and legal system , which is a fact , but that would not be solved by getting rid of the death penalty . You'd still have racial bias -- just a bunch of lifelong sentences instead of death sentences . The risk of being wrong is by comparison one which is actually directly related . I won't say I'm fully swayed , but I will say there's a serious amount of stuff in this argument that is worth thinking about . ﻿
0_40	. Which means get the right guy then put a bullet in his head . You are promoting torture . You are becoming more of a threat than he is .
0_47	seems to me it would have been more humane to kill the dudes than keep them in cages wrongly for 30 yrs﻿
0_49	I support the death penalty . But only for that forensic chemist . ﻿
0_58	If the capital punishment ( death penalty ) is abolished , what is your suggestion for the alternative ? Is life in prison ( psychological and physically affected by being jailed ) , more ethical than the death penalty ? ﻿
0_59	I'm a little surprised by the soft arguments . Seems like the presenter is really arguing for better investigations and trials . To say a bad chemist is a good argument for disallowing the death penalty only leads me to say to protect the chemical analysis process . The basic question is , is the death penalty a suitable penalty ? I think it is . I'd offer up Timothy McVeigh . Any problems in that case ? Probably not so I'm focusing on , is the consequence for his crime , death ? Again , I think it was . ﻿
0_60	The best way to silence arguments against the death penalty ( because the way it's administered is " cruel " ) is to hook up the condemned to an oxygen tube that supplies pure nitrogen . The person will grow sleepy with no symptoms of being oxygen deprived and die very peacefully . And his organs will be free from damage so they can be transplanted . This method was beta tested ( inadvertently ) on a couple of Martin Marietta engineers a while back .
0_64	well said . your the most rational comment here . i dont like the death penalty because i find putting someone to sleep a bit soft if they have done something really really nasty , but i admit there are times it seems ness . i wish the rest of people would think a bit more
0_65	" If death penalty is murder , then imprisonment is kidnapping " - JKM #Korwin ﻿
0_66	Why not ? Killing someone is justified in various instances , self-defense being the most obvious case . Besides , it strikes me as a somewhat benevolent punishment , at least compared to long decades of dependence , indignity and violence at the literal bottom of the society , among its worst . If the punishment is inflicted on a terrorist or a traitor - a quick , " soldier's death " is more dignified than keeping them confined and brainwashed , like some wicked living trophy . Let's face it - life is not the most important value , and if we want the humanity to do more than just live and eat - it should not be .
0_69	Sure , there are situations where mistakes are made , and people get executed unjustly . But this is not an argument for abolishing the death penalty . Accidents happen - sometimes innocent people die in car crashes , but I don't this is a sufficient reason to eliminate motor vehicles . Death penalty is supposed to deter people from committing premeditated murder - not murder in general ( I don't think it should apply to , say , crimes of passion ) . Besides , it tends to be rather uncommon - so , that may be a couple of reasons for the lack of strong correlation .
0_72	Keep the penalty for terrorism﻿
0_75	I didn't see a real argument for complete abolishment there . I completely agree that we should never kill someone who might be innocent , but some crimes really do merit death . The first story the guy shared ? Those 2 boys didn't deserve death , but the guy who actually committed the crime sure did . My position is just that the bar should be raised for death penalty cases . Instead of reasonable doubt , or does the crime merit death , the bar that must be crossed should be zero doubt . The crime was caught on film or in front of a group of many ironclad witnesses . Fewer capital sentences , but not outright abolishment . ﻿
0_76	I'm with you . The problem is not with the punishment , it's with the process .
0_77	abolish ? no restrict ? yes . with modern video and DNA technology , I would say better confirmed cases of mass murder like a mass shooter confirmed on video cameras , ect . should have the option of death penalty , when your face is on the video that they're using as evidence against you , you really can't say " the police screwed up the forensics " and you need to be permanently removed from society through death to end all the trouble you're causing for society . there are people in this world that just need to be removed and forgotten , not going to name names , but I can think of a few . ﻿
0_78	. ﻿
0_83	I said the whole system needs to be reformed in order to lower the costs . Transitioning to firing squads was just one of the reforms .
0_93	" I support the protection of life from conception to natural death . But a natural death for a murderer is a death on the gallows . " - JKM #Korwin ﻿
0_102	not including the ridiculous appeal process the US has , causing decades long stints on death row .
0_104	if there is concrete evidence that shows they did it , like video showing them committing the crime , I would be inclined to usually say yes , but I would agree to a single appeal . also , you didn't answer my question , which I asked first and that you replied with another question ...... that's downright rude .
0_106	" When they execute someone in China they charge the family for the bullet . The ? "
0_119	Here is the problem . This video only shows examples of people incorrectly sentenced to death . What about the people who ARE guilty of crimes that are currently deemed worthy of the death penalty ? What is the reason to spare them ? ﻿
0_123	So you think locking another human being in jail for the rest of their life is more humane ? It's not about moral superiority , because morals are simply not important to those who ignore them .
0_124	I would rather have latter system . Sparing the guilty results in the harm of more innocents . Yes the justice system can fail sometimes , but it by nature does not intentionally harm the innocent .
0_125	Very convincing , although I'll continue further research into this ongoing topic before I fully alter my mindset toward the death penalty . I've been an ardent believer in swift execution for the the atrociously worst convicted offenders , perhaps it's time I evolved . ﻿
0_127	that idiot chemist needs to be put to death . ﻿
0_131	How can killing innocents be worse than jailing innocents if value is subjective ? ﻿
0_133	You're right , I was a little off topic . I wrote it quickly ... But the latter part of my post holds true . Decisions are relative , so whatever number you output from your formula needs to be compared to something . When C = 0 , that quantifies value AFTER the person is dead . A person who is deciding if death is better than current conditions must then quantify their life BEFORE they die , which means C = 1 , thus all other values matter . If that output is less than 0 , then death is a step up . If you prevent death to such a person , then you're prolonging their suffering .
1_137	funny how extremist liberals like hillary clinton and BO are all for the death penalty when it comes to abortion ( even third trimester as the baby is being delivered ) , but they're vehemently against the death penalty for known killers , go figure ! ﻿
1_143	Society is like a house , when you don't take out the trash it becomes unlivable . If you're too crazy to understand that murder is wrong I see that as MORE of a reason to remove you from the earth . ﻿
1_144	In New Hampshire public hangings are still legal . Live free or die . God bless New Hampshire . ﻿
1_151	California can learn a thing or two from TEXAS .... ﻿
1_159	All , and I mean all , nygurs and muslims need to be executed immediately . That may seem harsh but it's nothing compared to what they are hell bent on doing to everyone else . And by everyone else , I mean humans . ﻿
1_161	Does the Death Penalty prevent murder ? Well ... I have yet to see one murderer who ever received the Death Penalty ever commit another murder , ever again . So ... Yeah .
1_162	Or any other crime for that matter . Rehabilitation rate for Death Penalty is 100% . No one who has received it ever commits ANY crime ever again .
1_163	That is the sad truth about California . It don't care bout the death penalty , all it cares bout is convictions . Now the prison systems are running out of places to put people ........ my guess is if they would use the death penalty they wouldn't have that problem .... but I am for it . I believe there are some sick and twisted people that just need to go﻿
1_164	A Sizeable portion of Prison space in Texas , New Mexico , Arizona ... is taken up with Out of state Prisoners from California . California pays other states to house their overcrowding .
1_165	seems kind of stupid to do that doesn't it ? If the death penalty was used , and not just a threat , then thing would b better off
1_166	All of California would be better off if they'd just kick the Liberals the hell out of power .
1_172	yeah , the recent escape of multiple known murders in States that don't institute the death penalty actually proves it needs to be expanded in all States and followed through with in a timely manner in cases where it's absolutely known the perpetrator actually did commit the crime .
1_175	The only reason why the death penalty wouldn't be a deterrent because the murderers are not afraid or convinced by it . Some murderers may even want to die , but in a way that they could suddenly wreak havoc for their own selfishness . The Constitution doesn't allow " cruel and unusual punishment " , and I bet a lot of us would implement such ! ﻿
1_177	It's not so much about deterrence as it is insuring that animal never has a chance to commit further crimes ever again . If it deters others , good . Besides the whole argument against it due to lack of deterrence is a biased and false one anyways . You can always point to a capital crime and say , " See ? He wasn't deterred " . But the number of crimes that were deterred is impossible to know BECAUSE THEY NEVER OCCURRED ! I guarantee you one thing though . Any who do receive the death penalty . Never commit any crime ever again . In that regard it has a 100% success rate .
1_180	I never believed in the death penalty , until I watched a lot of true crime stories . Instead of paying $ 30,000 to $ 60,000 a year to keep these death row types alive , I say give the people they offended a choice ! And , make them work ! Some definitely deserve it , and some do not . One woman because a very good person , but sorry to say Bush had to go with the law . I felt badly for her . I do not want innocent people to die ... some are in there wrongly , thank goodness DNA came along .
1_185	If you knowingly kill someone , you have violated society's laws and you deserve to die , abortion doctors AND criminals . Both are just as crazy and equally guilty of murder . Killing an infant inside or outside makes no difference , its still alive . Btw , texas is republican dominated , and ron white has right wing ideas , so yes , this was intended to push right wing policies
1_187	We have the death penalty and we USE it .
1_188	Hell yeah ! Gotta love Texas :)
1_189	All the Blue Collar comedians are real men !
1_190	Ron White is a REAL MAN !
1_191	You're right . A civilized society deals with the people who violate one another's right to live . And that means , you shackle ' em in and flip the switch .
1_192	I say , you violate someone else's right to live , you have given up yours . In my book , you deserve to be shot in the face on the spot .
1_193	Absolutely true ! They want to keep a murderer alive on our tax dollars . But they won't even give an unborn child a chance at life outside the womb ! That my friend is hypocracy at it's worst ! This is the main reason Social Security is going down the tubes ! We have exterminated an entire generation through Roe V . Wade !
1_195	God Bless Texas !
1_198	You never see massacres down here ! Screw liberals !
1_199	Wooohooo !!!! Lets go republican states !!!!
1_201	this is not complicated at all - for RAPE , PREMEDITATED MURDER , CHILD ABUSE , SELLING DRUGS you should be put on trial , you should be granted an appeal - then if found guilty , you should be taken downstairs in the court building , that day and terminated . Enough of this happy horseshit - time to set standards and maintain them in every state , every day .
1_202	" Hey guys , we found the guys that plotted the attacks on 9/11 what should we do ? " " Eh , put them in this jail cell , we'll give them free food and pay our money to keep them alive . " " Oh ok , that sounds like a good plan ! "
1_203	you liberals are the ones who are backward idiots .
1_206	no , we use an electric chair or a firing squad , they get to choose .
1_207	True . My adds is rather than wasting a bullet/injection or cleaning that cell of you mentioned . Just recycle them , ie : live harvest ALL useful bits on their body and sell it to the highest bidder . Maybe then the pathetic government can pay off some of its debts .
1_208	Luv Ron White . Wish we have death penalty and a harsher system in Australia . Its totally pathetic . Serious criminals doesn't get what they deserve , especially if you are rich . And something minor and you happens to be poor then they are ruined by the lengthy red tape court system .
1_210	Regarding the death penalty : Pros : 1 . Prevents criminals from escaping/being released to commit more crimes . 2 . Closure for grieving families . 3 . Taxpayers don't have to pay to sustain the lives of criminals . Cons : 1 . Too harsh for some crimes ( obviously wouldn't do it to a mere petty thief ) . 2 . Not harsh ENOUGH for others - let rapists starve in a single cell PACKED with other rapists . Nothing is cut-and-dried ; this is not a decision to make lightly .
1_214	. If this country would treat criminals like criminals they wouldn't have the overcrowding problem . And on a personal note , I would not lose one nights sleep over putting a bullet in the heads of the guys who murdered my father .
1_221	Canada is dumb . How can you not kill someone who has killed a child . I would do it myself without a second thought .
1_222	The death penalty ensures the cretin doesn't do it again .
1_223	i like your usename . your not for the death penalty , yet you wish death upon us all with cancer . Hypocrite
1_225	Why is the discussion about it not being a deterrent even had . No , it's not a deterrent ... so f-ing what ... IT IS A PUNISHMENT !!! I could not give a damn about it's effectiveness as a deterrent . That NEVER should have been the point .
1_226	I just think that if you maliciously take another human being's life ( that doesn't include self-defense ) , yours is forfeit . What gives you the right to keep on living when you've taken someone else's life away ? And I feel the need to specify that that's a rhetorical question , beause every person peacefully expressing their opinion gets attacked on the internet .
1_229	With the death penalty I can GUARANTEE you that your children will NEVER be molested , raped , killed or kidnapped by the bad guy . I know you cannot guarantee anything with rehab . I believe in making sure that our kids have the best chance . It's just a difference of opinion on how to handle people who wish to kill your children .
1_230	They are rehabilitated . Let's have them babysit your children ?
1_231	We could let them be YOUR roommates . I would rather kill those same people .
1_232	i bet if the movie theater massacre happened in Texas , John Holmes will get the death penalty and we all know that Texas loves to kill it inmates that are on death row . Ron's so right about our death penalty . Texas Pride .
1_233	I understand compassion and what you believe in but when peole see you kill someone for no good reason , there's gonna be consequences . You kill 2 or more and we should end you before you end us . The sad laws of basic survival : kill or be killed .
1_235	I want to kill murderers , child molesters and the like . you want to keep child molesters and rapists alive . You want to keep the theatre killer alive ? I want to chop him up ( kill him ) . I am clearly a scumbag . Lol .
1_236	i know i'm late to the argument .... but the bible specifically has punishment for things like murder . Multiple felons are sentenced to punishments based on their transgression . So using " christianity " as a reason to not have a death sentences is self defeating .
1_238	For a punishment to be an effective deterrent , it must be carried out in more than a few cases and in a timely manner . I know that if I kill someone in most states , I have a very high chance of never receiving the death penalty . And even if I do , I could probably appeal my way out of it . If we actually used the death penalty ( and it took less than 45yrs to get it done for people who are sentenced to it ) , trust me , it would become a deterrent .
1_239	Every state should have the " express lane " .
1_241	It may not be " foolproof " but it takes a lot of sickos out of this world who don't diserve to contnue living because they have killed multiple people FOR NO REASON . Pro death penalty
1_246	That explains why you didn't directly reply to me . How backwards are you ? Having the death penalty would still be cheaper because there would be relatively less prison guards needed on payroll , since they'll just kill the prisoners anyway . Prosecution costs are cheaper than that of meals and guards . Law enforcement cost would remain the same , as all that's changing are the consequences of crimes , not cop behavior . Legal protection would only rise a bit in the short run .
1_248	They are illogical because they make no sense whatsoever . The human body needs about 2000 calories per day , and with an evergrowing population , food costs more and more . You are trying to convey that somehow , by some inane possibility , feeding a large amount of prisoners , 3 times a day , for 365 days a year , . The cost is high , but in the long run , it is cheaper . You really are an idiot .
1_250	" Every study shows a bias against minorities AND . " I can't even begin to describe how illogical that sounds . You're an idiot .
1_251	We can't let the murderer out because he killed ( hypothetical ) your daughter . If we let him out , he might kill your wife . We can't leave him in prison for life , that's cruel . We can't kill him , that's cruel . The truth is .... We CAN kill him , to get rid of him ... to send a message to others . It's the best choice . I don't want to kill anyone but more important than my emotions is ...... the need to rid the planet of this horrible person . A baby was just born . Kill the killer before he finds the baby
2_252	yes to death penalty﻿
2_253	Death penalty will provide closure for the family's victim . if there is no death penalty the criminals are happy while the victim's family suffer from strong grief or extreme trauma﻿
2_257	Get a gun , yea ? Dig a hole yea ? Shoot him in the head , yea ? Bury the cockroach(imagine the tony montana voice ) . P.S. when people say that people can be wrongfully convicted and recieve Capital Punishment , can we not say the same is happening to people who are wrongfully accused and get life in prison ? So in my oppinion no mattet what side we look at it from . Innocents will always be convicted for crimes big or small . ﻿
2_263	You said : " There is no demonstrate that executions deter people from committing crime ... " , I partially agree with this statement . What happened in Singapore when they implemented the death penalty ? If you research about it , you'll clearly see that , the indice of crimes in Singapore has drastically decreased , and if you research a little bit more , SINGAPORE IS THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD . ﻿
2_267	People take the 8th Amendment too far , there is nothing cruel and unusual about being hung . It happens quick , and fast . ﻿
2_269	So ... let me ask this then . A man kills five people for no reason other than doing so because he felt like it . That's five people he mercilessly killed with no remorse . Five innocent people . So , he's captured . What punishment would you wish on him ? ﻿
2_271	I'm in favor of the death penalty law . Death penalty is not murder , it is self defense & a deterrent to crime , society has to defend itself against criminals , executed criminals will never murder again . I'm Italian living & working in Singapore , I admire Singapore's discipline & strict death penalty law for criminals & drug traffickers ; as a result Singapore is a free drug society & has low crime rate . I wish there was death penalty in Italy . Crimes are increasing in countries where there's no death penalty & where jails are like 1st class hotels﻿
2_291	YOU WIMPY HYPOCRITE CRYBABIES !!!!! HOW WILL YOU FEEL IF YOUR WIFE , DAUGHTER OR ANY CLOSE RELATIVE IS KILLED ??? MY HEART & MIND WILL BE FULL OF REVENGE !!!! EITHER YOU ALLOW THESE MURDEROUS RATS BE EXECUTED LEGALLY , WE SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS OR BRING LYNCH MOBS !!!! AND LYNCH MOBS WILL BE WORSE : ANYBODY CAN BE EXECUTED & WITHOUT TRIAL ! YOU CRYBABIES BUMS WANT THAT ? YOU ARE GOING TO GET IT ! ﻿
2_297	In Europe we have another problem , the extreme left wing ruling our countries totally ignores the need of extreme criminals to be punished . Criminals are better protected than citizens ... guys who lost their driver's license 5-10 times because of hit and run , than kill someone with a hit and run , STILL get their driver's license ... . Murderers reject the food they get in prison because their steak is a bit too bloody , etc ... it is ridiculous !! One guy once said : ' A society is projected on how it treats its prisoners ' and ever since they started treating their prisoners better and better , and their citizens worse and worse . Probably because it's cheaper ... ﻿
2_300	pro capital punishment﻿
2_301	How about hang a murderer right after confirmed guilty in a court of law ? they abort babies like there is no tomorrow why not start killing the scum of society so they don't go out and rape more women ... you see how the cycle works eliminate the rapists and there will be no need for abortions anymore . ﻿
2_307	1 argument for that trumps your 5 against , Closer for the victims . Unless you've lost a loved one to a murderer , you have no idea what that closer will bring to them . And by the way , these arguments can all be picked apart ... pretty weak stuff . Representation can work in favor of both sides , the , depends on a lot of factors , f*ck ups ... you made that an argument ? Are we using Wikipedia as our academic source too ? ﻿
2_309	If my brother killed someone , is Ava's argument because you bring personal emotions and feelings into the debate . Naturally , if someone has more skin in the fight they feel stronger towards a side . Killing to prove killing is wrong is a misleading statement here . Youre killing a killer who may kill and harm others again , you're preventing further harm . A baby is as innocent as any human could be . Two opposite ends of the spectrum . No comparison .
2_312	In cases in which the convicted is definitely guilty of murder , there should be no dispute , considering that those who do dispute such things probably do not dispute the concept of being paid what they are owed for things otherwise . ﻿
2_319	so you wouldnt mind that a child molester being released after his prison became your neighbour ?
2_325	I will do it for free if you send my way a moron who raped and killed kids . ﻿
2_326	Hell yeah . Finally an educated person in this comment section . Too many idiotic pussy liberals .
2_328	If they receive the death penalty , carry it out . Midnight after being sentenced a . 22 in the back of the head . . The best reason for the death penalty ? The cock-sucker will NEVER do it again ! ﻿
2_329	There will be the initial cost but my way is a bullet on the night they're found guilty so no dragging it on forever . Good idea on the bigger ammo . How about we use some of those billion bullets Napolitano bought ? lol
2_330	This wot save money most money goes to the process before execution like courts , jury and appeals . One more thing a . 22 wont do shit best to use 5.56 or . 45 :)
2_331	+little luck I could not agree more , but they would have to kill 2 or more people in my opinion﻿
2_332	" Deterrence " Who cares if their afraid or not certain crimes should have death as the punishment . " Botched Executions " shows A problem with the method of executions not for executions " Innocent Executed " shows another problem with the system . same argument can be made that we shouldn't imprison people because they could be innocent . ﻿
2_335	The executioners didn't harm/kill and innocent person , they killed a convicted criminal of murder and gave closure to the victim's family .
2_337	That is why the state conducts the trial to determine the death penalty , so their is no vengeance or ill wrath . If a family member of the murdered made the jury's decision or murdered the murderer , then it would be vengeance .
2_338	Do you have kids ? Cause let me tell you , if some man took my little girl , raped her , then smashed her head in with a rock , you bet I would want him dead , and I would shoot him myself . Or how about baby Brianna's killers . Go look that up on YouTube and tell me those monsters don't deserve death . These are not humans but creatures and creatures get killed .
2_342	Population control﻿
2_344	I don't believe it's cruel & unusual to put to death someone who has murdered/killed an innocent person . ﻿
2_346	i don't care what reasons you have aginst the death penalty , if someone kills another , it's only fair to kill them .. can you imagine having someone you know get killed ?! how would you feel knowing who ever did it is still alive ﻿
2_348	feed them to the lions and crocs in zoos , thats a plus﻿
2_352	Cheaper to behead or use a firing squad﻿
2_359	If you kill someone on purpose you should also get killed and if it's not on purpose then the people should look into it and give different sentences for different reasons . ﻿
2_360	Why don't they just do what they did back then . If they are proven guilty next day take them outside set up a five man firing squad problem solved also no f*ck ups just aim for the head or torso but if they survive just put one more round in there head . ﻿
2_361	It still dosent save y'all any money .
2_367	Instead of those sentenced to death , they should be used as laboratory experiments for government use as actual human test subjects . It may not be constitutional but neither is the NSA tap wiring into our homes﻿
2_370	I believe in the death penalty if there is correct justification for the outcome﻿
2_372	In most criminal cases seeking justice and retribution are unimportant things . If someone is extremely violent towards living things they are not human and should forfeit their life . ﻿
2_375	Maybe I watch to much Game of Thrones but I think people should get beheaded when given the death penalty . ﻿
2_378	Naa too quick , if someone say , raped & murdered my wife i'd want to hear him scream in agony , for at least 5 - 10 mins thats just me tho i love my wife .
3_405	The U.S. Justice Dept are pushing for the death penalty re the Charleston Church shooting . Lets hope they get it , if they do it will send a message to any other murdering fukkers . ﻿
3_406	Idiot Ian Islop says dont have the death penalty just in case the person being executed is innocent . Ok then lets take Ian's argument even further : Lets REALEASE EVERYBODY IN PRISON JUST IN CASE THEY ARE INNOCENT , RIGHT ? WRONG !!!!! ﻿
3_408	What about the ones that are guilty ? They dont get the death penalty either . Bring back capital punishment NOW !!
3_409	Hey idiot go learn how to read . I said '' LETS TAKE HISLOPS ARGUMENT EVEN FURTHER AND REALEASE EVERYBODY FROM PRISON JUST IN CASE THEY ARE INNOCENT '' . NOT IAN HISLOP SAID LETS RELEASE EVERYONE FROM PRISON . You need reading lessons . Also forget about god . Hes forgotten about you . Instead start concentrating on what matters , like the victims of serious crime . GO VOTE TO BRING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT , LIKE I DID . THEN GO TO READING CLASSES . IDIOT !!! LOL !!!!
3_410	Harriet Harmen is only concerned about capital punishment in case her husband gets the death penalty for claiming expenses on his porno collection ( he tried to claim money back via his wife for his collection of porno material ) This just goes to show you must NEVER believe a thing this woman says . In view of that I now trust you will all vote to bring back capital punishment right ?? ﻿
3_411	Some idiot left a comment saying capital punishment does not work in any way . It works in the Most important way of all . It stops the fuckers from going out and killing some other poor so and so . so BRING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NOW !!!!!!!! ﻿
3_412	I'd vote for the death penalty tomorrow . ﻿
3_416	Hey retardo , several times I have asked you whats wrong with '' revenge '' . Still you dont give an answer . Probably because you dont have one . Also , it was YOU that gave that 88 percent figure to ME ( I sent you the actual comment where YOU stated the 88 percent statistic ) not me to you . So in summing up : I say you are completely clinically mental . And should be sectioned under the Mental Health Act . I am still analysing your comments to see if you are actually a danger to society . If I feel you are I should really notify the authorities . I probably will anyway . Keep an eye out for men in white coats and straight jackets .
3_417	of course there should be a death penalty . Its a no brainer . ﻿
3_418	AS MANY AS POSSIBLE I HOPE !!!!
3_433	Take a life , forfeit your own . The only way for a safe society . Denise Bulger agrees . How would you feel if it were your child ? ﻿
3_434	No answer from Daniel Ryan , another one who disregards Bible teaching and wants murderers let loose on our streets . Perhaps he should consider that God wants a safe society for us all , that God is interested in the victims not the perpetrators of crime .
3_436	We are discussing capital punishment which is scriptural . If you want to discredit me , prove otherwise . You won't be able to . Jesus was concerned with the Old Testament , he often referred to it and said He came to fulfill the law and the prophets . I wouldn't dismiss the OT if I were you . I think you'll find the NT says ALL scripture is inspired by God , and this was before the NT was in existence . Now , tell us , what comes before forgiveness ?
3_438	It seems , as it says in Romans 2 ( New Testament ) that you may be guilty of what you accuse others , twisting the bible to suit your own agenda ? Capital punishment is scriptural . God says it , not I . See my post 6 May which explains why executioners of the state do not commit murder . " Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death " .... Exodus 21.12 . God says it , not I . I am staying on topic , which is - capital punishment .
3_455	... and the ones against it think that a rapist , murderer etc etc must not die ! Really ... lets protect the monsters of this world , and keep them alive . Weak people ! Lets continue to overcrowd prisons so that taxpayers can pay for their meals , and accomodation etc etc .... get a grip﻿
3_465	In my opinion , death penalty is a justified punishment for people found guilty of severe crimes like mass killing , torturing and raping , assuming the person perpertrating these crimes was of a sound mind at the time of these crimes and shows no signs of regret or improvement ... Death penalty acts like a perfect deterrent and prevents such a person from offending again .... ﻿
3_466	I think the death penalty should be reinstated . Because when a criminal takes away the victims freedom then why should the criminal deserve a life when he has taken away someone else's life .
3_468	Terrorists like members of the IRA , ISIS , etc should be put before a firing squad & shot or sent to the gallows , just like in the old days . William Joyce was a British Nazi traitor who was hung for treason in WW2 . Chopping heads off of a Syrian soldier isn't on . ﻿
3_470	I would maintain that execution , if not as a deterrent , functions as a prevention mechanism : even if perhaps applicable only to subjects with explicit goals of future murder who seem immune to rehabilitation .
3_471	I cannot agree with " life in prison solves it " - because from almost any angle , it clearly doesn't solve it ( and in an alarming number of cases makes things worse ) .
3_478	bring back death p for the fucking leftists﻿
3_483	criminals can get away with murder , vandalism , harrasement vandalism etc etc etc﻿
3_491	, rubbish look at countries where they carry out capital punishment , murdes are low
3_497	In cases of murder , rape , paedophilia , and treason ( including terrorism ) the death penalty should be available to the jury in exceptional cases﻿
3_503	! } Nobody cares if its a deterrent or not . 2 ) . ( 3 ) Cut the death row time . Problem solved . ( 4 ) Some murderers are in prison and we KNOW they did it . No guessing . No hearsay . No supposition . THEY DID IT ! HANG THE FUCKERS !!! (5 ) YOUR GUILTY OF BEING A DICK HEAD ( Just thought you needed reminding again sorry )
3_506	Yes but what about the ONES WHO WERE PROVEN THEY DID THE MURDERS YOU STUPID CUNT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3_512	, and how about the cold blooded murders are they not monsters
3_516	She's awesome and hot and capital punishment , God willing , will come back to the UK one day . ﻿
3_523	Not that I support death penalty , but I am surprised that people who debate in favour of it in the video failed to point out that death penalty would actually prevent the crime from happening in the first place which would rule out innocent victims . I think that would have been the most obvious argument against those who oppose capital punishment due to the potential of sending someone innocent to the death row . ﻿
3_525	Talk about a proper deterrent ... ¬_¬
3_533	Murder is the premeditated , cold blooded killing of the innocent.so if the Birmingham 4 Guildford 6 would of be given the death penalty you are saying the government has murdered them , well done
3_536	It amazes me that so many woolly minded liberal arseholes are still preaching that capital punishment was never a deterrent to murder . Well I beg to differ ! As a kid growing up in 50's Britain the knowledge that an execution was taking place had a profound effect on our young impressionable minds , as indeed did the threat of the cane ! Of course it didn't work for everyone , but any deterrent is better than non at all as we are now discovering . ﻿
3_538	Does this prove a correlation between the two ? Who can say for sure ? The only thing we can say with any certainty is that statistical data alone cannot win the argument for either side . Which brings me back rather nicely to its deterrent value on young , impressionable minds . As it was to me in the 1950's .
3_542	Bullshit . . Why on hell will you wait an average of 11 years to put down the murderer ?
3_550	yeah and you've been in solitary confinement it seems . There are thousands of people in solitary confinement across the United states , some only get out for 1 hour or less a day . None kill themselves , even the most cold blooded gang banger . yet the liberals will be the first to kill themselves when put in this situation , yeah fucking right . When you are in that situation and realize what it means to end your existence forever you wouldn't go through with it . Even the survivors of suicide , specifically people who jump from the golden gate bridge came to this realization . you guys live in a fantasy world .
3_561	if you want to talk about death penalty , I think it clearly should be legal because people have a right to support who they want to live and not live ....
3_563	Tony Blair abolished the death penalty for treason . I wonder why ? Did he know something we didn't ? The fact is that it MUST be reintroduced . Our country is currently heaving with seditious vermin who are members of a global child raping slaving cult . The filthy vermin in the mosques and their fanatical followers teach one thing ; that they have an OBLIGATION to lie to , undermine , subvert , subjugate and enslave ALL other people . N o-o ne ANYWHERE in the world is safe living near or amongst vermin who regard them and their daughters as prey . WHEREVER Muslims are in numbers they become increasingly violent ALWAYS . ﻿
3_565	Clearly none of these peoples children have been raped or murdered , if they had im sure there woul be a different saying in the audience . ﻿
3_570	If a member of my family touched up a kid then ye , take his/her head clean off
3_573	Capital punishment can be a deterrent , but that is not it's purpose . It's purpose is to get rid of scum and provide closure to families . Having said that , murder is not always a crime ; it depends on whether the person deserves it or not . ﻿
3_575	I would love to execute them myself ! It would be a dream job , coming up with all the methods and everything ! Boiling , acid , human microwave , oh and you gotta have some scientific testing as well , at least to get some use out of them .
3_579	uk needs to bring back the death penalty in extreme cases . ﻿
4_581	Make the death penalty quicker for them . The day after the case ends ... DEATH !!! ﻿
4_583	If one day , I have a choice between saving the life of a death row inmate or yours , I'll choose none . I would rather prevent the death of an innocent child .
4_586	brian shoemaker . who mentioned food ?? let them eat scraps from the bins . maybe theyll just wither away . problem solved .. ﻿
4_588	Woot ! My state might readd the death penalty again !
4_590	death is way too easy a punishment for these freaks . how do you suffer when your dead ? stick the pricks , aswell as all the kiddi fiddlers , in the main part of the jail population and let them sort them out . Allow them to be torchered everyday so they have a fair idea of the pain and torcher the families of their victims feel everyday . And unless any of you do-gooders have lost a relative or friend to something awful like that , please feel free to take these idiots into your home and see how well that works for you . ﻿
4_591	This society is in need to ensuring these bastards never kill again . ﻿
4_594	Some people are beyond redemption . ﻿
4_597	Thank you . The thing is we support the victims ' families , unlike anti-death penalty people , who support the victimizers and don't give a shit about the murderer's victims .
4_598	If someone I loved was raped and or killed , I would want this penalty for their killer . They would deserve nothing less . They did the fucking deed , and they NEED to pay for it . They made the willing to decision to take an innocent persons life . You anti-death penalty people , talk to the loved one of someone who has been murdered , and see how they feel . ﻿
4_599	I agree with him , those who kill innocent people don't deserve to live .
4_602	An eye for an eye , a life for a life . Seems fair to me . ﻿
4_603	At least some one gets it
4_609	The answer is in 3:32 - 3:57 . No additional facts are necessary . If your loved one has been a victim , this will make sense to you .
4_613	Hey guys I am a liberal ! If you rape 390839038298398423 babies , kill 999999999 pregnant mothers , and gargle newborn dicks , you will only be put in jail for life :) Free food , shelter , occasional basketball games in the courtyard . YAAAAAAY ANTI DEATH PENALTY !!!!!........ ﻿
4_615	Well , they deserve it because of the things they did , so that's fair .
4_620	I am supporting death sentence to the day I die ﻿
4_625	Very Well Done ! Hope you got an A+ ! As for the moron below me who says " Death to the Death Penalty " ... Well ... LOL ! I hope the rapists and mass murderers go to your house , or that you get the bill for housing , guarding , and feeding the baby killers of the world ... Numpty ... ﻿
4_627	Murder is the illegal taking of life . The death penalty is a justified , legal , systematic taking of life . Murderers and rapists surrender their right to live when they choose to commit such atrocities against society . ﻿
4_630	The death penalty is the best way of dealing with the evil scum that destroy lives . DEATH IS JUSTICE If you agree follow me on twitter @deathforcrimes ﻿
4_634	Death penalty for life !!! ﻿
4_656	4th . Another lame comparison . You can't help where you live . You live where you can afford but if you go out and murder 10 people , I think everyone can agree that , that is something you have control over and that's the choice you made to break the law . Everyone can't be rehabilitated .
4_657	1st , comparing changing poverty to changing a sentence for people who have committed horrible crimes is lame . 2 . . It is the unlimited appeals process . There should be only one appeal and then that is it . Richard Ramirez was on death row so long he died of natural causes . That doesn't even make sense . 3rd . Yeah some humans are equal to dogs . You act like a wild animal you should be treated as such
4_659	Keeping those asshole's alive so they can kill an inmate that has a lesser sentance or worse a guard . Another person killed becuse this piece of shit did'nt get executed , another kid loses his father because dad was working a double shift at the prison , thats sounds pretty expensive to me . Plus I've seen the data , . Personally I think we are to humane about it . Execution's should be public and gruesome , then people will think twice b4 comiting murder !
4_660	First off your most likely a privileged person who has never seen a real hanus crime take place ! If you do your tune will change quick , trust me . Second by your little peace sign Im guessing you work at Starbuck's , you're a liberal , and you don't understand . It's just another cause for you to rally behind . Michigan was the first state to get rid of the death penalty and guess what , they want it back now . I wonder why ?
4_662	They are not being '' murdered '' . Everyone knows their is a death penalty and when you go out and rape and kill children and receive it . . . well I consider that more a form of suicide than '' murder '' . . Why keep them alive ? We put dogs down for running wild . The same needs to be done for people The death penalty has been around since the beginning of time . No point in changing it now
4_664	Know what's weird ? I know democrats who believe in abortion but not the death penalty and Republicans who believe in the death penalty but not abortion . I believe in both and I think we should keep both .
4_665	Oh , and let me add , I'm not a democrat or republican . I'm an independent . * The death penalty always comes back to party lines that's why I added that
4_666	It's not outdated . Millions of people still believe in the death penalty . I stay in California and , while the numbers were tight , most people voted to keep it . I'm 25 and I support and believe in it . I know many young people who do
4_670	Murdering and killing are not the same thing . Murder is an unlawful and premeditated killing of a human being by another . A kill , is the act of ending the life of someone . Would you consider a cop killing a criminal that's threatening your life a murderer ? Would you feel safe , living under a government that is not allowed to take someone who's trying to kill you down ? I don't think so .
4_672	'' Murdering '' murderers . Breaks my heart . . . Those poor , poor murderers . It's right up there with the Genocide in Rwanda and 9/11 on the things that make me sad . Tragic
4_681	We need the death penalty in every state . People care more about the criminals than they do about the victims . Getting rid of the death penalty is step one . Before you know it , people are going to be against violent criminals getting life in prison cause it's '' inhumane '' .
4_683	I believe there is a place for a Death penalty . Some Crimes are so Heinous , so Horrible ; That the only responce that We as a CIVILIZED nation have is to " BRING THE MOTHERF ... R DOWN " . makes sense .
4_684	To my opinion , I'd suggest that Capital Punishment should be legalized .
4_689	Make special prisons for the most heinous of offenders . Not unlike Auchwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka . We have too many people making a life out of getting in jail , too many people loving a thug lifestyle and golifying crime . Give them enough to eat just so theyll starve slower , executions are carried out at random . See how many people will want to return after a 1 year sentence . 1 year . If they commit another crime and return . Life . Cheap , inexpensive and fair . Show them mercy ? Did they show mercy ?
4_692	If you are a sociopath , you feel NO pain . Get real .
4_693	Again , thank you for your common sense . Not all people are worthy of life .
4_695	Thank you Chance for speaking your mind with common sense . I do not want these animals living next door to me or anyone else for that matter .
4_698	If there is no doubt that the person deserves the death penalty then allow them to be murdered but don't do these pussy excutions that cost way to much money . Take them out back and shoot them in the head . Right after they get the death penalty . It is suppose to be used to detour people from doing these crimes if you are going to keep someone on death row for 20 plus years then it does no good . I don't understand are death penalty as it is now . It is a form of revenge not justice . But that may
