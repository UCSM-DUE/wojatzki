1_138	LMAO﻿
1_139	when you record off the tv make sure to check the volume and hold the camera still﻿
1_140	Instead of shooting them in the leg , tap their shoulder and say " excuse me " . ﻿
1_141	I fucking hate California ... ﻿
1_142	I moved to Calif ( Oceanside ) . My husband was in the Marines . Instead of my name , " Elaine " ... they always called me " Texie . " I felt awkward the entire time I was there ..... I just didn't fit in too well . I was so glad to get back to Ft . Worth , TX
1_145	Most boring state in the U.S. Hell I'd rather live in Alaska
1_146	i think people who feel the need to record something off of a tv screen and post it on youtube require the death penalty .... ﻿
1_147	read what rebel born wrote ... ﻿
1_149	And somehow is the most powerful country in the world . It's okay to be jealous . ' Merica
1_150	" I motioned the bartender to meet me in the Liquor Room . " - From that sentence on I expected gay porn to break out .
1_153	More like having individual freedoms , no state income tax , affordable living , and most importantly , a governor who is not a complete libtard idiot buffoon . I would move to TX in a heartbeat if I could . CA is a nightmare . I know people who live there who want out desperately .
1_154	Texas beats the shit out of Cali . And I have family in Cali .
1_155	It is just the complex phenomenon of the mind or involuntary reaction of notions . ﻿
1_156	If people are that sane why have a death penalty and a prison too . It is just there in the society and hard to know why . ﻿
1_157	"' Who's shooting me in the leg ? '" I wonder quietly to myself . " Oh , that guy . " POW ! Never turn around . ﻿
1_158	Don't place the blame , son . It's easy that way , but it ain't honest . ﻿
1_160	does anyone know if aggressive death penalty laws prevent murder or is it difficult to say since Texas probably always had the death penalty ? ﻿
1_167	y not go and get rid of everyone and start from scratch
1_168	I hope you're being facetious . Otherwise that statement is just too fucking stupid to comment on . I'll leave it to you to figure out why . If you can .
1_169	they have been on a roll the last few years !! ﻿
1_171	They always execute people before an election .
1_176	So logically , if a murderer is afraid to die , then why would he replicate that fear on those he harms ? Only at the point where you forfeit your life completely do you realize that other lives are forfeit as well . That's the tried-and-true pathology of any common murderer and I'm talking about the premeditated kind and not the passionate . If you don't think I have common sense , then you know nothing about our crime and punishment system and probably should be recused from participating in civic duty in that regard , due to " incompetence " .
1_178	In Utah you can still bee killed by firing squad﻿
1_179	Why be so quick ? Seems the POS needs a little personal treatment , maybe two to three weeks worth .
1_181	Mark , bet you would not say that to duck's face ! Coward . Or , maybe even to mine , and I'm an old Tea Party person who once was a Democrat , till they started killing babies legally .
1_182	Damn ! He's good ! " I wonder quietly to myself . "
1_183	abortion doctors give a great service by keeping the human population under control .
1_186	Only in texASS !
1_196	Liberals are absolutely KILLING our country . Do I believe we should aid those we can't do it for themselves ? Yes , but there are too many holes in system so that homegirl gets to use hers lone star card while sending a txt on her iPhone .
1_197	Liberal this liberal that . You dittoheads all sound the same . I love Ron White , but I don't think this bit was intended as some kind of fanatical right wing mandate . Wow , you people are morons .
1_200	hope you can reach that goal . I understand .
1_204	whatever you jack ass
1_205	Are you sure they're innocent because most of them aren't .
1_211	So freakin ' good , I've got tears :D
1_212	what in texas hey hang people ?
1_213	My condolences . I can not a imagine how awful you must . feel . We may not agree on a lot of things , but this is at least a billion times bigger then politics .
1_217	Dear not funny comedian : California also has capital punishment . Find a dictionary and look up the the word research .
1_224	Well bless your heart .
1_227	yep , that too is also true , we Texans love our guns .
1_228	I would bet that in Texas , the bad guy might of only got off a couple of shots before the redneck theatre-goers returned fire . God help the Aurora injured , Rest in Peace the Aurora dead . God Bless Texas .
1_237	People would have more confidence in death penaly convictions if prosecutors , judges or police officers were EVER charged for misconduct .
1_240	He's a comedy genius ... But , as for the comments . Just FYI ... If someone is against the death penalty , that doesn't mean that that person loves criminals or is a pussy or is a disease . Not saying that there isn't a debate to be had ... Just don't single people out as pussies .
1_243	wins ! DING DING ! KO
1_244	im glad im TEXAN
2_255	Where are your sources ? ﻿
2_256	this is youtube where we spout whatever bullshit pops into our heads without any semblance of citation .
2_259	Ashraf i see . I we can keep them alive , I just dont want other people to get hurt .
2_275	Shannon , actually spending some decades in jail before being excuted is much worse than being brought to death immediately . The whole point of a justice system is to bring justice , also for murderers , even murderers of children . So they are also entitled to defend their case with any means , even if it takes years .
2_276	One more thing , Shannon . Most of the criminality in Western Europe is also done by foreigners . I don't care do much about racist opinions . Since it's just an opinion and I believe in a radical freedom of thoughts . It's just disappointing to see a follower of Jesus using racist arguments , while Jesus was anything but a racist . Have a great day ;) .
2_278	For fun .
2_279	you think putting them in jail is kidnapping ? XD its called punishment dumbass
2_282	Oh , I did not realise that , sorry . ^^ ;
2_285	+viper888 . It does not . It says pigs , not figs . LOL You're funny . I like you . ﻿
2_286	Findlay Provan , nicely said . ﻿
2_289	Amen
2_292	What a rubbish reply
2_293	Well , take it or leave it . Make your choice .
2_294	Take what
2_295	What ? You're making no sense
2_296	As I said , take it or leave it . Why can't you understand ?
2_299	aha aha dooooooooooooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy﻿
2_304	yeah , but here in germany for example you get imprisioned for max . 15 years in a jail that literally looks like a hotel ... you guys have no idea how hard it is to NOT kill someone here ...
2_305	Germany has had a very low homicide rate , especially if you discount the refugees , who haven't been reconstructed into law abiding citizens .
2_315	There's also no legal justification for the murderers actions as well . ﻿
2_316	You literally said in the for death penalty that there is no proof of an innocent person has been executed . But now your saying that is happened ( and it has ) . Make up your minds﻿
2_317	you put both arguments up ? hats off to your sir . that includes my prized colander﻿
2_321	what do you mean " his prison became your neighbour " ?
2_322	child moleters don't get life in prison only murders do .
2_324	Another outstandingly good video . : relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed :: relaxed : ﻿
2_327	This is so dumb . I won't explain it to you , you wouldn't want to understand it anyway . I just wanted you to know that what you said was dumb .
2_334	Do you agree in execution ? ﻿
2_339	We are ' somehow not able to properly end someones life ' because the European companies where the chemicals get made that are used in executions have started refusing to sell them if that's what they're going to be used for . So states are just winging it and trying to execute people with their own concoctions . ﻿
2_340	That's why we all shouldn't commit crimes . ﻿
2_341	a lot of people who commit crimes are mentally ill and/or do not care about getting in trouble . Not that it's an excuse or anything .
2_349	lol i can see all the americans raging in this vid﻿
2_350	Na , just Texans .
2_351	Certainly not Kiwis ( NZ ) nor scandinavians . ;)
2_353	it's you who made a complete fool of yourself on multiple occasions and can't admit it .
2_354	You were saying you were trying to show me that I'm wrong . I said you failed . That statement is logically correct whether I am right or not . ... and of course I am right . ;-)
2_355	Yep I failed at making you smarter but not at outsmarting you . However since you aren't gonna get smarter you're waisting my time so LEAVE
2_356	The people that need confirmation that they are somehow " smart " or have to reiterate that they " outsmarted " someone , usually are the ones that are really really dumb . I don't think you are the exception . Go get an education , dude .
2_357	OK Dude . PS - You say I repeat myself
2_358	The last one reminded me of the movie ' The Green Mile . ' ﻿
2_362	If only you posted this video a week before , it would of helped in my R.E exam !! ﻿
2_364	98% of abortions occur after the first trimester Full grown mammals do not have consciousness . Fetuses of 10 weeks old do have consciousness . Just give your source for these claims .
2_365	Oh sorry I meant to type at . When I type on my phone , I can't see what I'm writing because the letters are in the way . The phone must have used the word it thought I was typing . . its like 88-91% done in first trimester but its 12-14 weeks . That's still a pretty well formed baby . They can usually tell the sex .
2_366	What has the sex to do with brain fuction ? And where the fuck did you find that other information ?
2_368	I think there's a big difference between doing like the nazis did on the jews , and the NSA listening to your bullshit .
2_369	i agree
2_373	what an obnoxiously long post . i am not reading this .
2_374	lol
2_376	* Too . Sorry , my inner Stannis got the better of me .
2_377	you were done at I watch to much Game of Thrones lol
2_379	Very interesting vid ! Especially with the recent Boston bombing case . ﻿
2_380	Bruh ﻿
2_381	Isn't this reuploaded ? ﻿
2_382	No , what makes you think that ?
2_383	The other one is reasons for death penalty
2_384	Becuase I saw it in my subscription box and again
2_385	23rd view . ﻿
2_386	First﻿
2_387	Mope
2_388	Not quite , i won by 8 seconds :D
2_389	First﻿
2_390	Nor where you ...
2_391	Was I ?
2_392	If I was owner this channel , I will banned you all .
2_393	You will banned us all , banned , really ...
2_394	Oops !!! hhhhhhhh
2_395	first lololoololol﻿
2_396	Nope
2_397	I actually was soo ....
2_398	to get raped lololololol
2_399	Damn , you got me there !
3_402	Very dangerous woman . ﻿
3_403	Priti Patel is a dizzy motherfucker . How the fuck is this bimbo a M . P﻿
3_404	" This is really about our criminal justice system " ... yes . That's just a bland truism , what does that have to do with anything lol﻿
3_413	not a genius but I have a 3.7 gpa
3_414	congratulation's go to the top of the class .
3_419	Okay troll ..
3_420	LOL !!! I have come to the conclusion that I am the master of mass debating , YOU are the master of masturbating .
3_421	troll .
3_422	tw@
3_425	Abortion
3_428	I can prove Jesus existed . You cannot prove He does not exist . Over to you .
3_429	1 . Jesus isn't god , he is the son of god , except he isn't , cos god dont exist . 2 . God dont exist ( but if you want to attempt proving he does , go right ahead ) 3 . Your stupidity does exist , I have your comments to prove it .
3_430	You've contradicted yourself , yet again , and copied my words and phrases , yet again . Prove Jesus did not exist . Saying He did not , just won't cut it . Nor do you're silly insults . Once you resort to insults you prove you can't debate or back up what you say . All you have proved so far is that you are a totally inadequate person with an empty space where your brain should be .
3_431	Your just boring and sad . Have a great life in your religious fantasy world . I prefer the real world . Bye .
3_432	Copying me again . I told you you were boring , when you complained of being bored . Only boring people are bored . The fact that you've replied so many times means you have just contradicted yourself . Again . You're the one in the fantasy world , that's why you get your thrills from Harry Poter .
3_435	Ha ! Is that why Jesus went and sat with the sinners ? I think it's you who's disregarding Biblical teaching . As far as I'm concerned a lot of the bible deals with forgiveness ? Or , are you one of them who is just concerned with the Old Testament ? Christian , my arse .
3_439	If you want deterrents on the rapists and murderers so bad why don't you go back to your home country India , which has a lot of deterrents you want to keep you from being gangraped of course . ﻿
3_440	No . ﻿
3_441	" ultimate burden of proof " - this woman's bullshitting , the legal term is to meet the " standard of proof " , the " burden of proof " refers to whether the defence or prosecution has to prove a particular legal point . She's full of shit , and conning the public into believing she knows how the system works . ﻿
3_444	Priti Patel isn't very bright is she ? ﻿
3_445	No
3_446	She sounds a lot smarter than you ..
3_447	How very waggish of you
3_449	I don't know why she keeps going on about ' full burden of proof ' . We have to prove guilt as it is , it's just that sometimes the courts get it wrong . Does she think we currently convict murderers on a hunch ?
3_451	LOL !!!!!!! With every reply you give me your sounding more and more bizarre and unstable ( do YOU get the urge to kill ? Just imagine how ironic THAT would be ) You would make a wonderful case study at a psychiatrists seminar . At least promise me you will see a mental health worker , yes ? If not , have a great life . And DONT HURT ANYBODY !! Bye .
3_452	I don't know if I should laugh or yawn ... typical of the lazy minded to engage in ad hominines ... its a cognitive thing for you ... thinking can be hard work ... why bother right ? lol
3_453	I take it you're still on your medication because throwing insults at people who disagree with your opinion suggest that YOU are crazy and a bit simple .
3_454	I see you've stopped taking YOUR medication . This must be the reason why you care more about murdering scumabgs , than innocent victims . Hmmm , its you that's the simpleton I think . Get a brain that works , leave the illegal drugs alone and start thinking properly . FOOL !!!
3_456	And the terrifying thing is that the stupid Priti Patel , who cannot in any way justify her ludicrous and reactionary opinions , is now a minister in the British government ! ﻿
3_457	Can't stand the witch P . Patel . Her father once claimed " UKIP is not a racist party " . His annoying daughter is equally disillusioned . ﻿
3_458	must say uk has come a long way , the very country that introduced hanging to its colonies ' and hanged people who rebelled againts british rule﻿
3_459	Oh lord . Priti Patel is THICK AS PIGSHIT . ﻿
3_461	I agree , most criminals need help
3_462	Priti patal employment minister disgusting woman﻿
3_463	On Priti Patel's first statement ; I wonder how many murderers who are convicted and serve a life sentence come out of prison after 25 years and kill again ? Interesting to see them figures . ﻿
3_467	your ' civilized society ' is Bullshit . ﻿
3_473	Out of context and foul mouth tirade launched by out dignified little Dragon Boy , now came down to accusing others of being troll . Any wonder UK is lagging behind Germany on every single parameter of socio-economic development .
3_474	Yawn .
3_475	Germans should not talk about killing others . Ever .
3_476	I am just a German National . No war guilt here . Try harder .
3_479	lefties only car about the rights ofvthe criminals
3_480	lefties are peodophile lovers they wouldnt like it if it was there kids being raped or killed
3_482	its not just priti patel lots of people support the death penalty , cannot understand why they have all ganged up on her﻿
3_484	law is too soft in uk﻿
3_486	Here's a light-hearted distraction : keep pressing 0 for a Dimbleby machine gun . ﻿
3_488	, really ? so u do believe in capital punishment
3_489	So we can legalise murder then if we become the government/police ?
3_493	Priti Patel will never listen to logic because she is pushing a Muslim ideology , and the Religious are allergic to logic . ﻿
3_494	, shows how much of an idiot u r shes a hindu , us has capital ppunishment and a christain country
3_498	I wonder if Patel would be in favour of the death penalty if it applied to treasonous politicians ? ﻿
3_499	Priti Patel was as stupid then as she is now . ﻿
3_500	Indeed .
3_501	How does the death penalty serve as punishment to fit the crime for rapists ? Surely a life behind bars getting ass raped by muscly tattoed guys is more fitting . ﻿
3_504	Fuck me your a mental cunt
3_505	At the moment I am seriously thinking about wanting capital punishment for dopy cunts like you !!
3_507	Shocking that Priti Patel , is now in Government , neither views like this , but then she does fit the bill ..... female and Asian heritage﻿
3_508	lots of whites and male support death penalty
3_509	priti patel is a hindu not a muslim
3_510	That Patel is a quota token within the bounds of the Tories . ﻿
3_514	That was to you Courtney
3_515	hmm u seem to be for the murders
3_518	
3_519	to take a life to serve life behind prision without being parroled﻿
3_521	Priti Patel got voted in ! oh my word how on earth does this happen . and now she is a cabinet minister﻿
3_522	Conservative MP Priti Patel has been appointed as Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions . Her boss is Iain Duncan Smith . Look out . ﻿
3_526	Cool story bro .
3_527	Here's an idea : Instead of the death penalty , why don't we chop off body parts of the criminals and use them for medical science ? Have they attempted to do that ?
3_528	Yes , it's called Sharia Law in Muslim countries .
3_529	They use it for medical science ?
3_532	I agree .
3_539	﻿
3_540	
3_544	Priti Patel --- are you really such an idiot ? ﻿
3_545	OF COURSE WE ALWAYS GET THE WRONG MAN ! ﻿
3_548	but all can be punished via the death penalty
3_552	solitary confinement is designed specifically in part for people who are suicidal . solitary confinement is not punishment , you still have human contact . The mexican mafia is notorious for ordering hits outside the prison from within solitary confinement
3_553	I come at this from a completely different position of being incoherent . ﻿
3_554	Priti Patel , what a complete and utter idiot . Every word that came out of her mouth was utter crap . More women in Politics , yes , but not ones like her . Idiot . ﻿
3_555	haha ! ' IT'S NOT A DETERRENT KILLING THE WRONG PEOPLE!' Yes !!!!!!! ﻿
3_556	Priti Patel is like an English Sarah Palin﻿
3_558	why does the fetus have legal status after 22 week ? and not the 1st week ?
3_559	after 22nd week it is considered that there's intent to carry the pregnancy through and any harm to fetus would also be considered attack that could cause serious harm or death to mother and the fetus i/e potentiality a child . I'm sure if you look in to law books they have it better explained albeit bit more technical . for 1st week or even 12th week women/an could easily miscarriage and under law there are no provisions for miscarriage , for these can be caused by number of things , alcohol , drug abuse , havy smoking , lack of proper nutritional intake and illness .
3_560	" for 1st week or even 12th week women/an could easily miscarriage and under law there are no provisions for miscarriage , for these can be caused by number of things , alcohol , drug abuse , havy smoking , lack of proper nutritional intake and illness . " Thats a fair argument , so you're saying it's incredibly hard to have a miscarriage after the 22nd week ?..... interesting ...
3_562	u can also take a look on abortion in English law under common law . BTW you're really off the subject with abortion and death penalty nonsense here , which indicate to me that you're trolling .
3_566	wahahaha hope like like getting kicked from Google retard
3_567	wahahaha removing your comment like a little girl , or maybe you are defending rapists and pedophiles because you are one hmm , stands to reason I suppose . Delete your account pedophile lover
3_568	Gary Brown sucks dick for bus fare , then walks home .
3_574	Nah I'm just not a lily-livered liberal pussy with political correctness clouding my judgement .
3_577	Maybe because I'm not a criminal scumbag ? You fucking liberals , man , Jesus fucking Christ .
3_580	Lads , I think I fancy Harriet Harman a bit . ﻿
4_584	source ? ﻿
4_585	ok﻿
4_589	There are FAR worse things you can do to someone than kill them . Ian Brady convicted serial child killer in the UK has been serving a whole life tariff since 1966 . He has come to the realisation that he is better off dead so he is on hunger strike . He is currently being force fed . I hope he lives to 100 - 23 years to go ! ﻿
4_595	The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . ﻿
4_600	zzzzzzz
4_610	dont attack them they made it for a debate class and the video does not reflect their personal views
4_611	well thats the point isnt it ? they're not going to show them doing good shit are they ? its because they committed a crime ..... and what should the victims look like ? hardcore cunts ? sounds silly really doesnt it ?
4_612	ok
4_614	condemned *
4_618	If anyone knows the name of the song please let me know ? c : ﻿
4_619	Karma Police -Radio Head
4_622	anti death penalty person who wishes death for pro death penalty person .. how ridiculous
4_624	nice this helped me in school :D ﻿
4_626	I think John Floyd Thomas Jr. was sentenced to life in prison without parol not the death penalty . i am not sure tho ! ﻿
4_628	As disgusting as it is , should all rape be considered in the same terms as the taking of life ? I doubt it .
4_632	For all you people out there not aware of the political situation in other countries . Several Southeast Asian countries have the death penalty for non-murder related charges such as drug trafficking . And people think U.S.A is harsh . SMH﻿
4_633	But , yet the U.S has the 5th Highest Execution Rate , in the World . Nobody said the U.S was the most Inhumane Country . But you're leaving out the fact that many other Countries do have a better Human Rights Record than America does : The Falklands , Argentina , Canada , Greenland , Australia , New Zealand , & almost every single Country in Europe , undoubtedly has a better Human Rights Record than America does .
4_635	Liked the video and the song by Radio Head was perfect . ﻿
4_638	America ain't civilized in your opinion
4_642	Personal attacks instead of a counter argument ? Excellent tactic ! :p
4_645	None of those countries have it either .
4_646	You should be happy with how Ramirez died seeing as you like gruesome painful executions . Cancer is far crueler than any execution method on the books .
4_650	As far as I'm aware , Eric Casseus was not sentenced to death - he actually faced 5-15 years in prison . He maintained his innocence as well .
4_658	Other countries also don't have the same violent crime we have here in America and your right a fetus is not a baby to me either but millions of people not only believe that but are fighting to make abortion illegal here in America . Give it some years and it might happen
4_669	Death Penalty = Easy way out . Simple .
4_671	The government already does murder people you dumb twat have you ever heard of the military ?
4_678	Jerry's mug shot on this clip was from his time in Memphis when he was drunk and armed outside Graceland , yelling for Elvis to come outside .
4_679	Where did WALLFLOWERxiii get their information on Jerry Lee Lewis getting the death penalty for drug trafficking ? In 2012 he married his cousin's ex-wife and is living in Mississippi , not on death row . I can find very little to no information on his life of crime but what I have found is very disturbing , ie : killing grand jury witnesses , deputy sheriffs , police informants , etc . Why is this old " Killer " still free ?
4_682	Was wondering what's the song " s name :)
4_685	the best part of this video was the song . <3 Radiohead
4_686	To those monsters , I say good riddance .
4_687	Yes , good , appeal to emotion , that'll prove your moral argument .
4_688	ok guy at 1:43 lol wtf is that about ? did he use the child as a shield , and the police shot the child ? or did they murder him just for using the child as a shield , and no one was hurt ? that would be pretty stupid if the police accidentally shot the child trying to shoot the robber . and all for what ... money ? money that the police officer has no involvement in ? money that would've been easily replaced by the bank rofl . good judgment call bro , thats why u make the big bucks .
4_690	Fine , moron , then you can pay for it .
4_691	They can get more drugs than on the street , probably .
4_694	Thank You !!
4_696	Where exactly did you find the eligibility for death penalty information ? I have searched for a little over a month and haven't been able to find it .
4_697	just be me .
5_700	so my question to everyone here is if someone kills someone close to you would you want that person to still be alive ? the answer is a a simple Yes or No﻿
5_701	Yes﻿
5_703	* inhumane P
5_719	Is there any way that I can get the script or sub of this video ? ﻿
5_722	* cough 4% * cough or we could go back to the days where all you have to do is say witch and their dead . My facts from Stanford University ( Because I'm not a liberal basterd and find actual ligidament sourses ) ----> http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230.abstract
5_732	It's not the execution cost , it's the trial of actually endicting the person of a crime worthy of capital punishment that is expensive .
5_733	I want to take this brief opportunity to piss off as many people as I can , from both sides , with this : The hardest thing about being a Christian is to obey the words of Christ : " Love thine enemy " and " Let he who is without sin cast the first stone " . ﻿
5_734	Idc your religion is a joke
5_735	So is the word " Johnson " . Consult the movie ' The Big Lebowski ' .
5_747	I don't think that's the case in Singapore .
5_753	02:07 I thought she was reporting news﻿
5_754	02:11 But EU sucks . Sweden Democrats 2016 . ﻿
5_755	02:11 But EU sucks ! Sweden Democrats 2018 !!! ﻿
5_757	Yes . ﻿
5_767	the last comment in this video posed an interesting concept : -the relationship between progressivism , capital punishment , and secularism . My question is to those who would say they are secular in the sense of believing Darwinist/evolutionary theory & who DO NOT believe in capital punishment . -As a secularist in this sense , why is capital punishment wrong if it is merely a playing out of " survival of the fittest " ? ﻿
5_771	Not slightly surprised at a comment like that written by an ebony person .
5_772	They make them beg for death ? So they physically torture them or psychologically break them to the point of insanity ?
5_777	There shouldn't be a debate over the DP . You either believe in killing people , or you don't . Also , if you do believe in killing , and you support the DP , then you are ok with killing the innocent as well . Innocent are executed for the privilege of getting revenge on the guilty . This is inevitable and irrefutable . ﻿
5_779	my friend hates this video everyone in the comments hate him !!! ﻿

5_803	It seemed their was a higher portion of weirdos featured in this video then what society has . ﻿
5_805	Biased much , Vice ? ﻿
5_820	In america the new and improved death penalty will be a cash cow for the private jails . Death penalty is for the lazy and greedy soon to be the greedy and lazy . We all know the decapitated human body can be kept alive with right equipment for an indefinite amount of time right ?. You would need a stockpile of stackable , storage , watertight containers ( fema coffins ? ) that could hold one body plus equipment . You know for the " freshness " factor in the organ harvesting (& other fluid an bits ) by the aging elites . Well I would hope its for organs and not just a handy dandy snack in a pack for something else ... ﻿
