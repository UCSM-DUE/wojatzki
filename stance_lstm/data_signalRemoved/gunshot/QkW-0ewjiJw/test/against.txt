0_2	I see your point and this would probably work fine with those three examples , but it sets a dangerous precedent . What constitutes undisputable evidence ( for instance) ? These people also have the right to appeal their convictions , so there's no real way to simply execute them and save money ( they appeal and stay in death row for decades ) . Ironically , death row inmates cost significantly more money to the state than a regular inmate and so there really isn't even a monetary benefit to the death penalty . I just want to say I agree with the sentiment , maybe they deserve to die . However , there's no real way to carry that out justly .
0_6	The expense for minimizing the percentage of innocents on death row is much more expensive and it's never 0% .
0_9	Still cheaper than death row . The ' reasonable doubt ' requirement is a lot stricter for death penalty than life in prison - therefore more cost . Even with that strictness , you still get innocent people sentenced to death .
0_13	Fuck the death penalty and anyone who supports it﻿
0_16	Murderers deserve to die . The only reason I oppose the death penalty is because innocent people could get killed . ﻿
0_19	Very convincing ! I've always been against the death penalty , but you've certainly secured my position ! ﻿
0_22	No , it doesn't . It doesn't even make a dent .
0_27	How was your comment at all relevant ? You can prove someone in jail is innocent , and they can leave to live their lives . A dead person can't do that .
0_30	Wrong .
0_32	I can't accept the fact that we will inadverdantly throw some completely innocent lives to be executed along with killers and rapists . Let's abolish the death penalty . ﻿
0_34	Yeah , and it's retarded .
0_36	I disagree . Death Penalty is dangerous because of an incompetent police force and judiciary . Clearly now because of advances in genome sequencing we can now be more certain of identity . ﻿
0_39	Death is too easy for monsters . They should have to suffer for the rest of their lives . It's too bad there is no way to guarantee that the person convicted is guilty . ﻿
0_41	I was honestly on the fence about the death penalty . But this video brought up some pretty good points . I guess it's probably better to not have it . However , Idk , I just get the feeling that this channel is kind of manipulative and a little biased . Not a lot has shown me that , but just the way this video and some of there others were made . But besides that , good points . ﻿
0_43	One person commented that it is a shame folks across the political spectrum are not unified . Well , in Kentucky we are and if you are from Kentucky and want to join the growing number of folks across all faiths and political entities , then visit the website of the Kentucky Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and sign up to become part of the movement and someone who will make history soon when we abolish it in Kentucky : www.kcadp.org . I look forward to hearing from you . And congrats on this video . Well done . ﻿
0_53	Good points . Do you really want to give the death penalty option to the same institution that gave us Cash for Clunkers ? ﻿
0_67	You got me there . Self defense didn't occur to me . I don't believe prisons should ' confine and brainwash . ' I believe they should rehabilitate people , and study them to learn more about mental issues / disease , so that we can better combat them . How is a soldier's death in being electrocuted alive / injected with a needle any more dignifying than living out the rest of your days peacefully in a prison , because you refuse to stop harming society ?
0_68	If the state can just innocently execute 1 man . Say 1 out of 1000 or even 1 out of 10 , 000 , then I say it is STILL not justifiable and must be abolished . We already know of plenty cases where people were exonerated in the past decades after being proven innocent , how many people were already executed when they were in fact innocent ? There is no excuse , lock them up for life and outlaw the death penalty . Scientific studies have already shown that stricter laws in states where the death penalty is a punishment do not deter people from killing .
0_70	" Accidents happen " Wow that is not okay when it comes to human lives and when you could easily prevent it ..
0_71	I could not agree more﻿
0_79	can go wrong but it's much more rare because it's a far more consistent process . And is more ethical because it's far quicker . However no death penalty is acceptable as stated by the video because it's not worth the innocent people who will be killed .
0_91	The problem I see is that the so called " justice system " is flawed . The cops , detectives , forensics , lawyers and judges all participate in a system that unjustly convicts innocent people . Are you saying that none of these people at any point could figure out the innocent people were actually innocent . The problem is in the system , not so much the punishment . If people's biases due to race , class , religion , gender , hatred , revenge , etc . can be removed from the process and replaced with facts , maybe it would work as intended . Until then , good luck to anyone who gets dragged into that rat's nest . ﻿
0_94	Sounds like a real moron .
0_97	And death penalty , due to the legal system and I guess the finality of its verdict , is also extremely expensive , more expensive than the alternatives ... so really , argument for death penalty an entirely emotional one . ﻿
0_101	I agree with this video . Shame the people who aren't crazy tough on justice types are spread out all across the political spectrum and not unified . ﻿
0_103	Do you ? What is your opinion on this ?
0_105	I've already pointed out that I don't care about cost when it comes to these issues . However yes it does cost more even without the appeals process . You have the court case that leads up to the death penalty conviction costing more ( lawyers/psychologists , etc ) . Even than this appeals process is important since in some US states up to 90% of death row inmates in recent history have been found innocent .
0_109	Plain and simply put the state should not be killing it's own citizens , especially when proving 100% guilt is almost impossible . ﻿
0_110	That's not the specific problem I have with it . Its really that I , 1 ) would rather not see a state apparatus for killing people exist , and 2 ) I'd rather have the worst beings on earth live out their days in prison that risk executing in error even a single innocent person .
0_111	That's not true at all , humans including judges are prone to error because of sociobiological intuitive responses . Why is there widespread support for the minimum wage ? Why are so many people against immigration ? Because people are ingrained with biases . Two judges can easily reach the same wrong conclusions and it's the jury that comes to the conclusion anyways .
0_115	Taking a life when a life is taken is revenge , not justice . ﻿
0_116	If it is wrong for the individual to do anything is wrong for the group to do anything and the government is just a group . Murder is murder . It is always wrong . ﻿
0_120	Well you let them sit in prison where they aren't a threat to society .
0_121	Because the system has proven that it can't tell the difference between guilt and innocence in all cases
0_122	100% accuracy is an difficult goal to achieve . Even a 95% accuracy rating means that 1 in 20 criminals will not deserve their fate . I guess we just need to live with our serial killers or pay for their lives in jail .
0_132	Yeah , but this wasn't about euthanasia . This is about Killing innocents VS Jailing innocents . Killing them will always be worse , because regardless of anybody's opinion on the Value of A & B . If C = 0 , A & B will automatically become 0 .
