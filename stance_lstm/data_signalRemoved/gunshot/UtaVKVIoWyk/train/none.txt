0_0	locking up someone for thirty years is injustice . The person can't get back the time that they've lost in prison . No amount of money is able to compensate that . ﻿
0_4	Ostracize them . If they give consent , tattoo their crime across their forehead , take their bio-metrics and add them to a blacklist describing their crimes and then let them back into the community . If they don't agree to that I'm sure members of the community will gladly show them the way out of town and warn surrounding communities of the threat headed their way . To be shunned by friends , family and community in addition to every employer turning them away is a punishment worse than death in many ways .
0_5	that's actually pretty good . That'd keep anyone from committing crimes any day . And if there's been a mistake , at least it's easier to clean up than a death penalty .
0_12	Intriguing . What do you imagine that market death penalty system would look like ?
0_17	" We can't compensate for [ mistaken executions ] the way we do with mistaken imprisonment . " Oh , I didn't realize the government had a magic time machine they used to give back the years lost to people mistakenly imprisoned . This video has the feel of something a pre-teen would argue . Logic-less . Inane . Not at all academic . There are plenty of good arguments both for and against capital punishment . This video makes a mockery out of them all . Like it's a poor Saturday Night Live skit mocking Learn Liberty . Truly disappointing . ﻿

0_35	Getting rid of the death penalty isn't going to save people from being wrongfully imprisoned . You might want to find a better argument . ﻿

0_42	The Sweet Death Penalty http://www.gosto.org/#DeathPenalty﻿
0_44	Of course the death penalty isn't a deterrent . It takes 20 to 30 years to be put to death . The news doesn't report a murder that is soon followed by a trial and execution . The only time the media reports an execution , you can be sure that the crime and trial happened decades earlier . The threat of execution just isn't real enough . It's like the threat of dying from cancer 30 years down the road isn't real to a smoker . If you died months after smoking , not a single person would smoke ( unless they had a death wish ) . ﻿
0_45	WHO WILL PROTECT THE PUBLIC WHEN THE POLICE/GOVERNMENT BREAK THE LAW !!! " FUCK THE WORL AND THE GOVERNMENT TOO " ﻿
0_46	You guys realize people have reasons why they do the things they do . Understanding is key to fighting wrong doing . ﻿
0_48	the problem is with the investigation not the punishment . ﻿
0_50	Maybe he made a mistake . It's not like he would have done his job differently if there was no death penalty . It just means that his fallibility has graver consequences .
0_51	It wasn't " a " mistake . It was THOUSANDS of " mistakes " , again and again and again . Except strangely the " mistakes " only gave false positives , never false negatives .
0_52	This was the worst and most biased video I have see from learn liberty . The whole video was a display of the injustice in a justice system . It made no arguement for liberty . Only that the " justice system " did not provide justice two individuals and there was no discussion of liberty . ﻿
0_54	you could make this argument about any legal action﻿
0_55	Such as ?
0_56	Life sentences ?
0_57	And I'm sure people will object to that as well . I'm not sure if I would personally because I don't understand the scope of them , but still .
0_61	The point is Gov't can't be perfect . It can't even be " good " Throwing money to the issue won't solve anything . Better Training , more money , better infrastructure , more money , asking the second most death-friendly country ( China ) for help , etc . Won't ever be perfect . With stakes as high as ... you know ... life running risks isn't smart , but criminal . ... unless of course , you are a fan of Russian Roulette .
0_62	Why perfection ? You don't get this anywhere else ...
0_63	Well ... no civilized , free nation , at least ...
0_73	Haha ! If you're going to use an objective definition you'd have to execute all of the CIA and most of the former presidents .
0_74	I can imagine government gradually widen the definition of terrorism to make use of it .
0_80	? Are you serious ?

0_82	out of the $250M , how much do you think California can save by using firing squad ?
0_84	Hey , I'm going to have to write a paper for a basic philosophy class about the death penalty . We are STRONGLY encouraged to frame the argument in the idea of retributism . Both of these arguements had failed to hold against the concept of retributivism , can anyone please explain why it's wrong in that sense ? ﻿
0_85	The very error is in the name - " Penalty " . Prisons should be a means of isolating dangerous people to protect the rest of society , not punishment . It's a huge waste of human capital that could benefit the population if instead of providing prisoners with the goods they need to survive they just required them to provide for themselves by getting a job inside prison . ﻿
0_86	Those people should not be punished , they should be responsibilized . A lot of people talk of " paying the debt to society " , how is sitting your ass in a jail cell for months or years supposed to pay debts of any sort ?
0_87	what do you mean by " responsibilized " ? do you mean they shoud take responsibility and do something to compensate the victim ? if so why not punish them as well ? is it that you believe punishing them would be " immoral " ? if so subjectively or objectively ?
0_88	I respectfully disagree . The whole point of a justice system is the enforcement of necessary moral and legal norms . Punishment of crime is necessary for the maintenance of those norms . On the subject of using prisoners labors for a social good , I find that to be a dehumanizing and demeaning argument . To do so would be to treat prisoners as means to a social end rather than ends in themselves . We must respect their humanity by holding them accountable for their crimes , not use them as tools for our convenience .
0_89	You would prefer vigilante justice and revenge to official and impartial justice ? Are you confused ?
0_90	Deprivation of liberty as penalty for violating the rights of your innocent fellow citizen .
0_92	The narrator is wrong . Government doesn't make just a few mistakes . ﻿
0_95	Meanwhile in Europe ... PS : Excluding Belarus . ﻿
0_96	One limiting factor on guilt and innocence are the terms . We only have words for two cases ( guilt and innocence ) . Since these terms apply only to the results of a court case there are actually four cases . 1 . Truly guilty - actually did it and convicted . 2 . Truly innocent- actually didn't do it and not convicted . 3 . Falsely guilty - actually didn't do it but convicted ( worst case ) 4 . Falsely innocent - actually did it but not convicted We need words for the last two cases to have a clearer discussion on these topics . ﻿
0_98	they do all that for life sentence trials ....
0_99	no they don't .
0_100	This would be a more convincing argument if he had examples of people who were exonerated post mortem . Had the individuals mentioned been instead sentenced to life in prison , the story would have been the same - being on death row didn't affect the outcome in these cases . If anything , people dug harder to find the truth . Would they still be in prison had they not been on death row ? Maybe , maybe not . I'm not arguing the death penalty here , merely pointing out that this argument is also lacking . ﻿

1_154	Texas beats the shit out of Cali . And I have family in Cali .
1_155	It is just the complex phenomenon of the mind or involuntary reaction of notions . ﻿
1_156	If people are that sane why have a death penalty and a prison too . It is just there in the society and hard to know why . ﻿

1_158	Don't place the blame , son . It's easy that way , but it ain't honest . ﻿
1_160	does anyone know if aggressive death penalty laws prevent murder or is it difficult to say since Texas probably always had the death penalty ? ﻿
1_167	y not go and get rid of everyone and start from scratch
1_168	I hope you're being facetious . Otherwise that statement is just too fucking stupid to comment on . I'll leave it to you to figure out why . If you can .
1_169	they have been on a roll the last few years !! ﻿
1_171	They always execute people before an election .
1_176	So logically , if a murderer is afraid to die , then why would he replicate that fear on those he harms ? Only at the point where you forfeit your life completely do you realize that other lives are forfeit as well . That's the tried-and-true pathology of any common murderer and I'm talking about the premeditated kind and not the passionate . If you don't think I have common sense , then you know nothing about our crime and punishment system and probably should be recused from participating in civic duty in that regard , due to " incompetence " .
1_178	In Utah you can still bee killed by firing squad﻿

1_213	My condolences . I can not a imagine how awful you must . feel . We may not agree on a lot of things , but this is at least a billion times bigger then politics .
1_217	Dear not funny comedian : California also has capital punishment . Find a dictionary and look up the the word research .
1_224	Well bless your heart .
1_227	yep , that too is also true , we Texans love our guns .
1_228	I would bet that in Texas , the bad guy might of only got off a couple of shots before the redneck theatre-goers returned fire . God help the Aurora injured , Rest in Peace the Aurora dead . God Bless Texas .
1_237	People would have more confidence in death penaly convictions if prosecutors , judges or police officers were EVER charged for misconduct .
1_240	He's a comedy genius ... But , as for the comments . Just FYI ... If someone is against the death penalty , that doesn't mean that that person loves criminals or is a pussy or is a disease . Not saying that there isn't a debate to be had ... Just don't single people out as pussies .

3_430	You've contradicted yourself , yet again , and copied my words and phrases , yet again . Prove Jesus did not exist . Saying He did not , just won't cut it . Nor do you're silly insults . Once you resort to insults you prove you can't debate or back up what you say . All you have proved so far is that you are a totally inadequate person with an empty space where your brain should be .
3_431	Your just boring and sad . Have a great life in your religious fantasy world . I prefer the real world . Bye .
3_432	Copying me again . I told you you were boring , when you complained of being bored . Only boring people are bored . The fact that you've replied so many times means you have just contradicted yourself . Again . You're the one in the fantasy world , that's why you get your thrills from Harry Poter .
3_435	Ha ! Is that why Jesus went and sat with the sinners ? I think it's you who's disregarding Biblical teaching . As far as I'm concerned a lot of the bible deals with forgiveness ? Or , are you one of them who is just concerned with the Old Testament ? Christian , my arse .
3_439	If you want deterrents on the rapists and murderers so bad why don't you go back to your home country India , which has a lot of deterrents you want to keep you from being gangraped of course . ﻿
3_440	No . ﻿
3_441	" ultimate burden of proof " - this woman's bullshitting , the legal term is to meet the " standard of proof " , the " burden of proof " refers to whether the defence or prosecution has to prove a particular legal point . She's full of shit , and conning the public into believing she knows how the system works . ﻿
3_444	Priti Patel isn't very bright is she ? ﻿
3_445	No
3_446	She sounds a lot smarter than you ..
3_447	How very waggish of you
3_449	I don't know why she keeps going on about ' full burden of proof ' . We have to prove guilt as it is , it's just that sometimes the courts get it wrong . Does she think we currently convict murderers on a hunch ?
3_451	LOL !!!!!!! With every reply you give me your sounding more and more bizarre and unstable ( do YOU get the urge to kill ? Just imagine how ironic THAT would be ) You would make a wonderful case study at a psychiatrists seminar . At least promise me you will see a mental health worker , yes ? If not , have a great life . And DONT HURT ANYBODY !! Bye .
3_452	I don't know if I should laugh or yawn ... typical of the lazy minded to engage in ad hominines ... its a cognitive thing for you ... thinking can be hard work ... why bother right ? lol
3_453	I take it you're still on your medication because throwing insults at people who disagree with your opinion suggest that YOU are crazy and a bit simple .
3_454	I see you've stopped taking YOUR medication . This must be the reason why you care more about murdering scumabgs , than innocent victims . Hmmm , its you that's the simpleton I think . Get a brain that works , leave the illegal drugs alone and start thinking properly . FOOL !!!
3_456	And the terrifying thing is that the stupid Priti Patel , who cannot in any way justify her ludicrous and reactionary opinions , is now a minister in the British government ! ﻿
3_457	Can't stand the witch P . Patel . Her father once claimed " UKIP is not a racist party " . His annoying daughter is equally disillusioned . ﻿
3_458	must say uk has come a long way , the very country that introduced hanging to its colonies ' and hanged people who rebelled againts british rule﻿
3_459	Oh lord . Priti Patel is THICK AS PIGSHIT . ﻿
3_461	I agree , most criminals need help
3_462	Priti patal employment minister disgusting woman﻿
3_463	On Priti Patel's first statement ; I wonder how many murderers who are convicted and serve a life sentence come out of prison after 25 years and kill again ? Interesting to see them figures . ﻿
3_467	your ' civilized society ' is Bullshit . ﻿
3_473	Out of context and foul mouth tirade launched by out dignified little Dragon Boy , now came down to accusing others of being troll . Any wonder UK is lagging behind Germany on every single parameter of socio-economic development .

3_482	its not just priti patel lots of people support the death penalty , cannot understand why they have all ganged up on her﻿
3_484	law is too soft in uk﻿
3_486	Here's a light-hearted distraction : keep pressing 0 for a Dimbleby machine gun . ﻿
3_488	, really ? so u do believe in capital punishment
3_489	So we can legalise murder then if we become the government/police ?
3_493	Priti Patel will never listen to logic because she is pushing a Muslim ideology , and the Religious are allergic to logic . ﻿
3_494	, shows how much of an idiot u r shes a hindu , us has capital ppunishment and a christain country
3_498	I wonder if Patel would be in favour of the death penalty if it applied to treasonous politicians ? ﻿
3_499	Priti Patel was as stupid then as she is now . ﻿
3_500	Indeed .
3_501	How does the death penalty serve as punishment to fit the crime for rapists ? Surely a life behind bars getting ass raped by muscly tattoed guys is more fitting . ﻿
3_504	Fuck me your a mental cunt
3_505	At the moment I am seriously thinking about wanting capital punishment for dopy cunts like you !!
3_507	Shocking that Priti Patel , is now in Government , neither views like this , but then she does fit the bill ..... female and Asian heritage﻿
3_508	lots of whites and male support death penalty
3_509	priti patel is a hindu not a muslim
3_510	That Patel is a quota token within the bounds of the Tories . ﻿
3_514	That was to you Courtney
3_515	hmm u seem to be for the murders

3_526	Cool story bro .
3_527	Here's an idea : Instead of the death penalty , why don't we chop off body parts of the criminals and use them for medical science ? Have they attempted to do that ?
3_528	Yes , it's called Sharia Law in Muslim countries .
3_529	They use it for medical science ?
3_532	I agree .

3_544	Priti Patel --- are you really such an idiot ? ﻿
3_545	OF COURSE WE ALWAYS GET THE WRONG MAN ! ﻿
3_548	but all can be punished via the death penalty
3_552	solitary confinement is designed specifically in part for people who are suicidal . solitary confinement is not punishment , you still have human contact . The mexican mafia is notorious for ordering hits outside the prison from within solitary confinement
3_553	I come at this from a completely different position of being incoherent . ﻿
3_554	Priti Patel , what a complete and utter idiot . Every word that came out of her mouth was utter crap . More women in Politics , yes , but not ones like her . Idiot . ﻿
3_555	haha ! ' IT'S NOT A DETERRENT KILLING THE WRONG PEOPLE!' Yes !!!!!!! ﻿
3_556	Priti Patel is like an English Sarah Palin﻿
3_558	why does the fetus have legal status after 22 week ? and not the 1st week ?
3_559	after 22nd week it is considered that there's intent to carry the pregnancy through and any harm to fetus would also be considered attack that could cause serious harm or death to mother and the fetus i/e potentiality a child . I'm sure if you look in to law books they have it better explained albeit bit more technical . for 1st week or even 12th week women/an could easily miscarriage and under law there are no provisions for miscarriage , for these can be caused by number of things , alcohol , drug abuse , havy smoking , lack of proper nutritional intake and illness .
3_560	" for 1st week or even 12th week women/an could easily miscarriage and under law there are no provisions for miscarriage , for these can be caused by number of things , alcohol , drug abuse , havy smoking , lack of proper nutritional intake and illness . " Thats a fair argument , so you're saying it's incredibly hard to have a miscarriage after the 22nd week ?..... interesting ...
3_562	u can also take a look on abortion in English law under common law . BTW you're really off the subject with abortion and death penalty nonsense here , which indicate to me that you're trolling .
3_566	wahahaha hope like like getting kicked from Google retard
3_567	wahahaha removing your comment like a little girl , or maybe you are defending rapists and pedophiles because you are one hmm , stands to reason I suppose . Delete your account pedophile lover
3_568	Gary Brown sucks dick for bus fare , then walks home .

4_610	dont attack them they made it for a debate class and the video does not reflect their personal views
4_611	well thats the point isnt it ? they're not going to show them doing good shit are they ? its because they committed a crime ..... and what should the victims look like ? hardcore cunts ? sounds silly really doesnt it ?

4_624	nice this helped me in school :D ﻿
4_626	I think John Floyd Thomas Jr. was sentenced to life in prison without parol not the death penalty . i am not sure tho ! ﻿
4_628	As disgusting as it is , should all rape be considered in the same terms as the taking of life ? I doubt it .
4_632	For all you people out there not aware of the political situation in other countries . Several Southeast Asian countries have the death penalty for non-murder related charges such as drug trafficking . And people think U.S.A is harsh . SMH﻿
4_633	But , yet the U.S has the 5th Highest Execution Rate , in the World . Nobody said the U.S was the most Inhumane Country . But you're leaving out the fact that many other Countries do have a better Human Rights Record than America does : The Falklands , Argentina , Canada , Greenland , Australia , New Zealand , & almost every single Country in Europe , undoubtedly has a better Human Rights Record than America does .
4_635	Liked the video and the song by Radio Head was perfect . ﻿
4_638	America ain't civilized in your opinion
4_642	Personal attacks instead of a counter argument ? Excellent tactic ! :p
4_645	None of those countries have it either .
4_646	You should be happy with how Ramirez died seeing as you like gruesome painful executions . Cancer is far crueler than any execution method on the books .
4_650	As far as I'm aware , Eric Casseus was not sentenced to death - he actually faced 5-15 years in prison . He maintained his innocence as well .
4_658	Other countries also don't have the same violent crime we have here in America and your right a fetus is not a baby to me either but millions of people not only believe that but are fighting to make abortion illegal here in America . Give it some years and it might happen
4_669	Death Penalty = Easy way out . Simple .
4_671	The government already does murder people you dumb twat have you ever heard of the military ?
4_678	Jerry's mug shot on this clip was from his time in Memphis when he was drunk and armed outside Graceland , yelling for Elvis to come outside .
4_679	Where did WALLFLOWERxiii get their information on Jerry Lee Lewis getting the death penalty for drug trafficking ? In 2012 he married his cousin's ex-wife and is living in Mississippi , not on death row . I can find very little to no information on his life of crime but what I have found is very disturbing , ie : killing grand jury witnesses , deputy sheriffs , police informants , etc . Why is this old " Killer " still free ?
4_682	Was wondering what's the song " s name :)
4_685	the best part of this video was the song . <3 Radiohead
4_686	To those monsters , I say good riddance .
4_687	Yes , good , appeal to emotion , that'll prove your moral argument .
4_688	ok guy at 1:43 lol wtf is that about ? did he use the child as a shield , and the police shot the child ? or did they murder him just for using the child as a shield , and no one was hurt ? that would be pretty stupid if the police accidentally shot the child trying to shoot the robber . and all for what ... money ? money that the police officer has no involvement in ? money that would've been easily replaced by the bank rofl . good judgment call bro , thats why u make the big bucks .
4_690	Fine , moron , then you can pay for it .
4_691	They can get more drugs than on the street , probably .
4_694	Thank You !!
4_696	Where exactly did you find the eligibility for death penalty information ? I have searched for a little over a month and haven't been able to find it .
4_697	just be me .
5_700	so my question to everyone here is if someone kills someone close to you would you want that person to still be alive ? the answer is a a simple Yes or No﻿
5_701	Yes﻿
5_703	* inhumane P
5_719	Is there any way that I can get the script or sub of this video ? ﻿
5_722	* cough 4% * cough or we could go back to the days where all you have to do is say witch and their dead . My facts from Stanford University ( Because I'm not a liberal basterd and find actual ligidament sourses ) ----> http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230.abstract
5_732	It's not the execution cost , it's the trial of actually endicting the person of a crime worthy of capital punishment that is expensive .
5_733	I want to take this brief opportunity to piss off as many people as I can , from both sides , with this : The hardest thing about being a Christian is to obey the words of Christ : " Love thine enemy " and " Let he who is without sin cast the first stone " . ﻿
5_734	Idc your religion is a joke
5_735	So is the word " Johnson " . Consult the movie ' The Big Lebowski ' .
5_747	I don't think that's the case in Singapore .
5_753	02:07 I thought she was reporting news﻿
5_754	02:11 But EU sucks . Sweden Democrats 2016 . ﻿
5_755	02:11 But EU sucks ! Sweden Democrats 2018 !!! ﻿
5_757	Yes . ﻿
5_767	the last comment in this video posed an interesting concept : -the relationship between progressivism , capital punishment , and secularism . My question is to those who would say they are secular in the sense of believing Darwinist/evolutionary theory & who DO NOT believe in capital punishment . -As a secularist in this sense , why is capital punishment wrong if it is merely a playing out of " survival of the fittest " ? ﻿
5_771	Not slightly surprised at a comment like that written by an ebony person .
5_772	They make them beg for death ? So they physically torture them or psychologically break them to the point of insanity ?
5_777	There shouldn't be a debate over the DP . You either believe in killing people , or you don't . Also , if you do believe in killing , and you support the DP , then you are ok with killing the innocent as well . Innocent are executed for the privilege of getting revenge on the guilty . This is inevitable and irrefutable . ﻿
5_779	my friend hates this video everyone in the comments hate him !!! ﻿
5_780	" No man , no problem " -Joseph Stalin﻿
5_789	Of course thats completely subjective and not my point troll . Stfu
5_803	It seemed their was a higher portion of weirdos featured in this video then what society has . ﻿
5_805	Biased much , Vice ? ﻿
5_820	In america the new and improved death penalty will be a cash cow for the private jails . Death penalty is for the lazy and greedy soon to be the greedy and lazy . We all know the decapitated human body can be kept alive with right equipment for an indefinite amount of time right ?. You would need a stockpile of stackable , storage , watertight containers ( fema coffins ? ) that could hold one body plus equipment . You know for the " freshness " factor in the organ harvesting (& other fluid an bits ) by the aging elites . Well I would hope its for organs and not just a handy dandy snack in a pack for something else ... ﻿
