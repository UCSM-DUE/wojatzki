5_699	PUSSYS ! MAKE THE DEATH PENALTY IN ALL 50 STATES﻿
5_704	Another brainwashed leftist parroting nonsensical propaganda .
5_705	Every murderer should hang for their crime . Think the state shouldn't decide whether someone lives or dies ? Those murdering bastards certainly took it upon themselves to do so . Why can't we ? Think killing people for killing people is wrong ? Then how is any punishment moral ?! Think it's cruel ? Tell that to the families of children raped , tortured , and murdered by these animals . , nitrogen asphyxiation , lethal injection , hanging , all these are more humane than the psychopaths they are used on . Think death penalty is uncivilized ? I would call letting killers live to kill more innocent people uncivilized . And why are prisons civilized ? It deprives your beloved criminals of their precious freedom ! ﻿
5_708	Liberals also believe that ISIS must be destroyed , aka killed . How many people cheered when Osama bin Laden was killed ? It is a double standard to call for the abolishment of the death penalty and killing of ISIS . ﻿
5_709	Masculine men prefer the death penalty . Higher testosterone individuals tend to favour right-wing ideals , including nationalism and just punishments , whereas effete tend to favour softer values and solutions . ﻿
5_711	Fuck you . Go suck the dick of a murderer .
5_713	LOLOLO NO ! We are asking for the death penalty again in our state
5_714	I believe the death penalty should be a choice for all criminals serving a sentence of 10years or more for crimes such as ; tax evasion , treason , rape , paedophilia , child molestation , acts of terrorism , corruption , kidnapping and murder of the first degree . The method of execution should be as follows either , death by , death by lethal injection , death by beheading or by being hanged by the neck until dead . ﻿
5_715	I believe a person who takes the life of another with no remorse should not be given a chance , when the person they killed wasn't given that opportunity﻿
5_717	Well I find it wrong to think that all life is equal . An innocent life is worth a lot more then that of a life of a murderer .
5_718	works better then oh no jimmy don't rape and murder again slaps wrist and sets fee and i have to agree with OMGUKILLKENNY2 , if they kill someone that means their " barbaric " so they should be treated that way . They don't respect life so why should i respect theirs ?
5_720	i agree with death penalty , i want rapists and killers should be killed ! i mean if u just keep them behind bars there just gonna break out again and start there rampage . ﻿
5_724	Yes that would be bad but what is even worse then that if a friend or family member was raped or killed and that person just gets a small slap on the wrist and gets set free and does it again . False execution is bad but I'll take it over letting criminals keep killing . I would rather one person die out of accident then someone kill 10 people and get away with it and kill more 10 > 1 even if that one is family because all of those 10 could be as well .
5_726	I know right . Should we stop convicting people . Only idiotic liberals are against the death penalty .
5_728	I understand what you are saying . But there are people who have spent their entire lives in jail and probably some who have died in there . Let's go hypothetical for a while . I'm sure you agree that someone like the Joker deserves the death penalty . Now there are criminals who view murder the same way he does . The death penalty should only be issues if it's proven beyond a doubt who the criminal is .
5_729	And most of them are useless niggers anyway .
5_730	A life for a life . The death penalty should only be for murderers , rapists , and child molesters . ﻿
5_731	If the trail cost is so expensive just put him or her in a room with no food or drink , that cost nothing﻿
5_736	Why do people sympathize with murders and rapists ? It makes no sense to me . ﻿
5_738	Then let's fix that problem . DNA , video cameras , and confessions are what we should use for evidence , not eyewitnesses . I know people have been wrongly put to death , but getting rid of the death penalty entirely isn't the solution .
5_739	Because these people are morally bankcrupt . Just look at them . Pure filth .
5_740	That's why I stated that we should only rely on undeniable evidence . If the system is corrupt , stop their corruption . Don't ban the death penalty where they can still be corrupt . As for if he's poorly represented , there still needs to be solid proof of his crime . There are people out there that we know exactly what they've done and should be put to death . When there is a grey area , don't sentence a man to death .
5_742	I support the death penalty but it should be only used on terrorists , spree killers , and serial killers . The best mode of execution is the electric chair . ﻿
5_743	a hanging is the best or a beheading
5_745	I'm totally in favor of the death penalty law . Death penalty is not murder , it is self defense , society has to defend itself against criminals , executed criminals will never murder again . I'm Italian living & working in Singapore , I love it in Singapore , I admire Singapore's discipline & strict death penalty law for criminals & drug traffickers ; as a result Singapore is a free drug society & has low crime rate . Death penalty is truly a deterrent to crime . I wish there was death penalty in Italy . Crimes are increasing in countries where there's no death penalty & where jails are like 1st class hotels﻿
5_749	if your mother daughter sister or child were raped and brutally murdered I have a feeling some of these people would be singing a different tune﻿
5_751	* cough men , all a woman has to do is say rape and he is convicted without proof . and that's only 4% that actuly get the death sentence http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230.full <-- from Stanford University
5_752	Do you think the people they killed died painlessly and peacefully ? NO so why so their death be painless and humane ? ﻿
5_756	I support the death penalty fuck the liberals﻿
5_758	Oh really ? Barbaric are the ways that those who receive the Death Penalty MURDERED THEIR VICTIMS . They didn't give their victims the right to live . ﻿
5_759	the only humane way of executing someone is to convince them they where found innocent then you nuke them when they least expect it ... anything else is inhumane and unacceptable ... but then again so would randomly nuking places to kill them .... ﻿
5_760	we need to torture them first , i would like to see them fight to the death and that would be fun to watch﻿
5_761	0:54 - 1:00 YES SIR ! ﻿
5_765	and the fact that these people care that these murderers or rapist are going through pain means they don't seem to care for the people they have killed and or terrified there entire life . ﻿
5_766	unless you are dumb or clearly have no fear you won't care but if death is your punishment then most people will think twice before creating a event where they know if they get caught there life will come to an end . people should already know this that if you don't want to get the death penalty you don't do something you know will put your life at stake and thats how simple it is . ﻿
5_769	Im having a hard time feeling sorry for those who have had botched lethal injections , did you kill your victim in a humane way ? ﻿
5_770	Exactly my thoughts . Those fuckers killed without mercy . Fuck humane executions , I wish we still fry'd those fuckers . If someone raped and killed your family member , do you really think they should continue to exist in this world ?
5_773	The only goddamn reason that executions are so expensive is be cause we worry too much about being " humane " so we came up with this expensive drug method . Once someone is dead they don't feel shit . and rope are cheap . ﻿
5_774	YES !!!! There should be a death penalty if u kill someone u should b killed y should the killer live while the victim or victims are dead it makes no sense & another thing that makes no sense is the ones that do get the death penalty they can sit on death row for yrs & the tax payers have to pay to keep them y not save some money & just kill them within weeks or months of there sentences ﻿
5_782	I don't understand why it has to be humane . The people who are given the death penalty probably didn't act humane ﻿
5_784	I would also bring public shaming back ! Rapist , murderers , pedos , all get regular advertising like a McDonald's commercial . There's an App for that ! ﻿
5_785	Wish I was president , death row would be completely empty . . Keep the line moving ! I would put the word death really into the " death penalty " these sick monsters sit there for 20 or 30 years on taxpayers dimes . Our leaders don't care they don't pay for it . ﻿
5_787	Every opposing person or group of the death penalty are those who have never had to come home to a empty child's bedroom or a cold lonely bed because there husband or wife was murdered by some monster . Put back on the streets for the government agenda of " population control " . I want these confused bias liberals to go speak to the mothers and families of these victims . I tell you what if any of these savages come near my family I have my own Death Penalty . ﻿
5_791	Simple behead them they have easy death and leave rest to Almighty ...... ﻿
5_795	European Union only cares about the rights of killers . ﻿
5_797	Death Penalty is natural punishment for murders ! ﻿
5_798	Death penalty is a YES . ﻿
5_799	The only reason the death penalty doesn't scare people in the west is because you sit around in a cell for years before they kill you . It should be you face a judge , and if he decides your guilty than immediately off with your head . If the punish was immediately following the guilty verdict you know darn well people would not commit crimes that they could get killed for . ﻿
5_801	It's amusing how people think the electric chair is inhumane compared to the current method , lethal injection . Brain death occurs almost instantly from the initial shock . No chemicals to measure , no recipes to screw up . One shock and done . The rest is to stop the heart , which is quite the tough little organ . That said , the death penalty has a place . It is more humane by its very nature than locking somebody in a cage , oftentimes alone , for decades on end . I know I'd rather take a bullet than sit in an eight by six box , alone , for fifty years or more . The death penalty and life without parole are the same punishment , one is just immeasurably more cruel . ﻿
5_804	hypoxia obviously﻿
5_806	Why even bring this up ? Of course there should be a death penalty . Like they said you don't have the right to choose who lives and who dies , the government nor criminals . A life for a life seems just about fair tho . ﻿
5_807	Who the fuck are these people ? They think like children who have never seen the real world . It's also interesting that the people here were mostly against it when the opposite is true in the majority of america . ﻿
5_809	Like the UK ? Crime capital of Europe
5_810	why don't they take their organs to save other peoples lives . if you take a life you have to save many﻿
5_811	Molesters , Rapists , Serial Killers and War Criminals all should be punished . In a world that is ever so growing how can we be able to house and feed these people when they have not complied with our laws . Should we waste our tax paying dollars to incarcerate them !? I really don't think so . ﻿
5_812	Man kills 69 teenagers and stays 21 years in Norwegian hotel prison . He admits hes crimes and doesn't regret and rallies hes fans and talks about killing more people . That seems fair ? Some people , even some parents of the victims , said that he will feel bad inside and that's big enough punishment . Whoo let him go ! ﻿
5_815	I mean lethal injection can be a 50/50 chance ? ﻿
5_816	Death Penalty isn't about barbarism or whatsoever . It's about giving the appropriate , and definitive , punishment to someone who commited a murder in cold blood . ﻿
5_819	I don't think the death penalty shoul be seen as a deterent because the people that deserve it probably won't care about it . I don't think it should be a go to but I definatly think there are special cases where it is right . If someone has raped children or murdered a lot of people then there is no use keeping them around . ﻿
