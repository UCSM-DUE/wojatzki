2_252	yes to death penalty﻿
2_253	Death penalty will provide closure for the family's victim . if there is no death penalty the criminals are happy while the victim's family suffer from strong grief or extreme trauma﻿
2_257	Get a gun , yea ? Dig a hole yea ? Shoot him in the head , yea ? Bury the cockroach(imagine the tony montana voice ) . P.S. when people say that people can be wrongfully convicted and recieve Capital Punishment , can we not say the same is happening to people who are wrongfully accused and get life in prison ? So in my oppinion no mattet what side we look at it from . Innocents will always be convicted for crimes big or small . ﻿
2_263	You said : " There is no demonstrate that executions deter people from committing crime ... " , I partially agree with this statement . What happened in Singapore when they implemented the death penalty ? If you research about it , you'll clearly see that , the indice of crimes in Singapore has drastically decreased , and if you research a little bit more , SINGAPORE IS THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD . ﻿
2_267	People take the 8th Amendment too far , ﻿
2_269	So ... let me ask this then . A man kills five people for no reason other than doing so because he felt like it . That's five people he mercilessly killed with no remorse . Five innocent people . So , he's captured . What punishment would you wish on him ? ﻿
2_271	I'm in favor of the death penalty law . Death penalty is not murder , it is self defense & a deterrent to crime , society has to defend itself against criminals , executed criminals will never murder again . I'm Italian living & working in Singapore , I admire Singapore's discipline & strict death penalty law for criminals & drug traffickers ; as a result Singapore is a free drug society & has low crime rate . I wish there was death penalty in Italy . Crimes are increasing in countries where there's no death penalty & where jails are like 1st class hotels﻿
2_291	YOU WIMPY HYPOCRITE CRYBABIES !!!!! HOW WILL YOU FEEL IF YOUR WIFE , DAUGHTER OR ANY CLOSE RELATIVE IS KILLED ??? MY HEART & MIND WILL BE FULL OF REVENGE !!!! EITHER YOU ALLOW THESE MURDEROUS RATS BE EXECUTED LEGALLY , WE SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS OR BRING LYNCH MOBS !!!! AND LYNCH MOBS WILL BE WORSE : ANYBODY CAN BE EXECUTED & WITHOUT TRIAL ! YOU CRYBABIES BUMS WANT THAT ? YOU ARE GOING TO GET IT ! ﻿
2_297	In Europe we have another problem , the extreme left wing ruling our countries totally ignores the need of extreme criminals to be punished . Criminals are better protected than citizens ... guys who lost their driver's license 5-10 times because of hit and run , than kill someone with a hit and run , STILL get their driver's license ... . Murderers reject the food they get in prison because their steak is a bit too bloody , etc ... it is ridiculous !! One guy once said : ' A society is projected on how it treats its prisoners ' and ever since they started treating their prisoners better and better , and their citizens worse and worse . Probably because it's cheaper ... ﻿
2_300	pro capital punishment﻿
2_301	How about a murderer right after confirmed guilty in a court of law ? they abort babies like there is no tomorrow why not start killing the scum of society so they don't go out and rape more women ... you see how the cycle works eliminate the rapists and there will be no need for abortions anymore . ﻿
2_307	1 argument for that trumps your 5 against , Closer for the victims . Unless you've lost a loved one to a murderer , you have no idea what that closer will bring to them . And by the way , these arguments can all be picked apart ... pretty weak stuff . Representation can work in favor of both sides , the cost is inconsistent across the board , depends on a lot of factors , f*ck ups ... you made that an argument ? Are we using Wikipedia as our academic source too ? ﻿
2_309	If my brother killed someone , is Ava's argument because you bring personal emotions and feelings into the debate . Naturally , if someone has more skin in the fight they feel stronger towards a side . Killing to prove killing is wrong is a misleading statement here . Youre killing a killer who may kill and harm others again , you're preventing further harm . A baby is as innocent as any human could be . Two opposite ends of the spectrum . No comparison .
2_312	In cases in which the convicted is definitely guilty of murder , there should be no dispute , considering that those who do dispute such things probably do not dispute the concept of being paid what they are owed for things otherwise . ﻿
2_319	so you wouldnt mind that a child molester being released after his prison became your neighbour ?
2_325	High cost ? I will do it for free if you send my way a moron who raped and killed kids . ﻿
2_326	Hell yeah . Finally an educated person in this comment section . Too many idiotic pussy liberals .
2_328	If they receive the death penalty , carry it out . Midnight after being sentenced a . 22 in the back of the head . Saves tons of money . The best reason for the death penalty ? The cock-sucker will NEVER do it again ! ﻿
2_329	There will be the initial cost but my way is a bullet on the night they're found guilty so no dragging it on forever . Good idea on the bigger ammo . How about we use some of those billion bullets Napolitano bought ? lol
2_330	This wot save money most money goes to the process before execution like courts , jury and appeals . One more thing a . 22 wont do shit best to use 5.56 or . 45 :)
2_331	+little luck I could not agree more , but they would have to kill 2 or more people in my opinion﻿
2_332	" Deterrence " Who cares if their afraid or not certain crimes should have death as the punishment " High Cost " & " Representation " they shows A problem with the system not the punishment . " Botched Executions " shows A problem with the method of executions not for executions " Innocent Executed " shows another problem with the system . same argument can be made that we shouldn't imprison people because they could be innocent . ﻿
2_335	The executioners didn't harm/kill and innocent person , they killed a convicted criminal of murder and gave closure to the victim's family .
2_337	That is why the state conducts the trial to determine the death penalty , so their is no vengeance or ill wrath . If a family member of the murdered made the jury's decision or murdered the murderer , then it would be vengeance .
2_338	Do you have kids ? Cause let me tell you , if some man took my little girl , raped her , then smashed her head in with a rock , you bet I would want him dead , and I would shoot him myself . Or how about baby Brianna's killers . Go look that up on YouTube and tell me those monsters don't deserve death . These are not humans but creatures and creatures get killed .
2_342	Population control﻿
2_344	I don't believe it's cruel & unusual to put to death someone who has murdered/killed an innocent person . ﻿
2_346	i don't care what reasons you have aginst the death penalty , if someone kills another , it's only fair to kill them .. can you imagine having someone you know get killed ?! how would you feel knowing who ever did it is still alive ﻿
2_348	feed them to the lions and crocs in zoos , thats a plus﻿
2_352	Cheaper to behead or use a firing squad﻿
2_359	If you kill someone on purpose you should also get killed and if it's not on purpose then the people should look into it and give different sentences for different reasons . ﻿
2_360	Why don't they just do what they did back then . If they are proven guilty next day take them outside set up a five man firing squad problem solved also no f*ck ups just aim for the head or torso but if they survive just put one more round in there head . Saves us tax payers money ﻿
2_361	It still dosent save y'all any money . They most money is jurys and trials and appeals thats like th lead up to the execution
2_367	Instead of those sentenced to death , they should be used as laboratory experiments for government use as actual human test subjects . It may not be constitutional but neither is the NSA tap wiring into our homes﻿
2_370	I believe in the death penalty if there is correct justification for the outcome﻿
2_372	In most criminal cases seeking justice and retribution are unimportant things . If someone is extremely violent towards living things they are not human and should forfeit their life . ﻿
2_375	Maybe I watch to much Game of Thrones but I think people should get beheaded when given the death penalty . ﻿
2_378	Naa too quick , if someone say , raped & murdered my wife i'd want to hear him scream in agony , for at least 5 - 10 mins thats just me tho i love my wife .
