2_254	by killing the murderer u are only taking another person away from their family . how would u feel if one of your family members got the death penalty
2_258	I get where your coming from when you see these stuff you think some people need to die . But your wrong , it's no deterrent
2_260	Um if we keep them alive I don't see why we should kill them . If you didn't want that guy to reoffend don't release him . Life without parole exists you know . There's a middle way the question sin't should we release him or kill him
2_261	Ashraf just keep them in a cell their whole life ? if you think about it , thats a bigger punishment than death . Can you imagine being in the same cell for years ? Now I want your opinion , if a person killed 6 people and we sent him to life , but then after 10 into his sentance he shows signs of rehibilitation . Should we release him or hold him for the rest of his life ? In my opinion we should hold him for 10 more years and after that he would have parole .
2_262	Right . So he shouldn't get the death penalty case closed
2_264	I am against the death penalty . Is a legalized murder . . This law is immoral . ﻿
2_265	" Thou shall not kill " You're murdering someone when they're given the death penalty . Hypocrites . ﻿
2_266	Is there something wrong with the thinking that a person is taught that killing is wrong but the death penalty seems to justify ending a person's life . . I don't understand . People tell me there is a difference between the definitions of murder and killing and it seems to be true but how different are the two if they end in the same result . I plan to write a paper about this one day , so please respond and let me know what you think . ﻿
2_268	except when it fails
2_270	Well it depends . Assuming he isn't mental or had an abusive background , and he was 100% doing this of his own will a life sentence of at least 20 years must be given . But is the serial killing was especially gruesome or towards children or elderly life imprisonment without parole could be a good option . ( That would be a bigger punishment than capital punishment , in fact in America an inmate killed his fellow inmate to ensure he got capital punishment )
2_272	`It isn't self-defence . With the death penalty you have them at your mercy and they can spend their life in prison ( which can be a bigger punishment ) but you chose to kill them

2_274	I live in France where death penalty was abolished by Mitterand in 1981 along with homosexuality being considered as a medical illness . So glad . ﻿
2_277	What about hypocrisy ? " We're gonna show that murder is wrong by murdering people " . Great message there , guys . ﻿
2_280	Punishments are given so that the person being punished learns something from them . Death is final , so really ... death totally fails as a punishment . It's really only done so that people can feel some kind of sick satisfaction at another human's death .
2_281	dude I'm totally with you against Death Penalty ... I was talking to that other guy
2_283	There's no death penalty in Australia . Thank goodness . Hopefully America will soon follow . :) ﻿
2_284	I agree with your video i just wish there were sources to back yourself up﻿
2_287	The death penalty is murder . What gives us the right to take a life ? The Bible states " You shall not kill " there's no " unless " . I'm NOT in favor of the death penalty and never will be . Peace . ﻿
2_288	I'm so glad that we in europe are intelligent enough that there is ( excluding Belarus ) no country in europe that still has the death penalty ! It is clear that it is against the basic human rights and that is doesn't serve a purpose ! ﻿
2_290	Luckily Belarus dosen't even use it that much at all compared to America or other unintelligent countries
2_298	The only extreme left wing countries now are China , Cuba , Laos , and Vietnam . They all have the death penalty
2_302	Even without the risk of killing the wrong guy , I think it's wrong to kill somebody out of vengeance . It doesn't help bring any victim back , it shouldn't provide any satisfaction to victim's loved ones , and it doesn't make our society any safer . The lack of compassion people have for prisoners is astounding . The fact that a nation like the United States can't begin to make a push towards prison rehabilitation boggles the mind . ﻿
2_303	Like I said The death penalty is just vengeance wrapped up in a pretty bow and called justice Glad I live in the UK where it's abolished
2_306	Superman , no they are not the same thing , but murder is murder . Make them suffer for life in prison . Then the family will have justice , there will never be closure for their family whether the killer is killed or not . Some people are too eager to kill the killer , those ppl are idiots ! What if they killed an innocent person and find out years later it was someone else that murdered the victim ???!!! ﻿
2_308	The fact of the matter is that the death penalty is just illogical . Killing to show that killing is wrong just doesn't make sense . If your brother killed a person would you gladly support his execution to give his victims family closure , there is a flip side to every coin my friend
2_310	number 4 the government doesn't pay shit the tax payers do WE DO TO END LIFE'S OF INNOCENT !! ﻿
2_311	One of my arguments is that death is a easy way to escape true punishment , as they be released from isolation and danger that will most likely happen in prisons . ﻿
2_313	I believe execution still exists , it's antiquated and barbaric . No , I don't condone the practice . ﻿
2_314	Number 1 is exactly why the death penalty shouldn't be legal ! When someone is wrongfully executed for a crime they did not commit , it is everyone's responsibility to pay for the error and look for the real killer ! Don't make accusations or jump to conclusions until all the facts are in ! ﻿
2_318	I am against at all costs . ﻿
2_320	Did you ever hear of a Life Sentence ?
2_323	Over here in Hong Kong we don't have death penalty fortunately . ﻿
2_333	who kill people , because killing people is bad . LOGIC﻿
2_336	Killing people to show that killing is wrong is just illogical Personally I don't want to believe that I would be happier having known that another human has been killed . No matter what they've done . It's just wrath and vengeance wrapped up in a pretty bow and called justice
2_343	Generally , I am against the death penalty . I understand why people are for it , but I feel that it is hypocritical to kill someone for killing someone . I might feel differently if someone I loved was murdered , but hopefully I never have to find out . ﻿
2_345	just cut their hands off then they will feel the pain of stealing or murder﻿
2_347	If someone killed someone I love of course I would want the mother fucker to die but that's why it's not up to me there's a process which is so often is flawed . If the wrong person is killed then that's murder .
2_363	How about this ' all life is holy ' thing that anti-abortion people use ? ﻿
2_371	Death penalty to the death penalty ! ﻿
